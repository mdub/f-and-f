      and the quality of his service... The Church was his deepest interest; he gave its service first place in
      his life; he spent hundreds of hours in the train on his way up and down to Diocesan meetings, his
      attendance at which was never surpassed by those who live in Wellington, His legal acumen and sound
      judgment of men and things gave an added value to the service he so ungrudgingly and self-sacrificingly
      gave to the Church. And to crown it all he was a devoted Christian."

      b 30.10.1940
      Barbara b. at Woodville and m. at Holy Trinity Church, Gisborne. Peter, s/o James William McMechan
      and Mary Catherine (Maisie) McKenzie, b. at Winton. Address: 39 Ann Street, Dunedin.
      Barbara was Head Prefect at Gisborne Girls' High School and Peter at Southend Boys' High School.
      Both graduated MA from Otago University. After marriage, Barbara and Peter both taught in Hastings
      secondary schools and then in England (1967-68), touring Europe extensively on vacations. A further
      year in Hastings followed and in 1970 Peter took a position at the University of the South Pacific,
      Suva. Barbara did some part-time teaching at the University and was much involved in the Anglican
      Cathedral Parish, school organisations and the University Boat Club. Both were very active in Arts
      Club drama and musical productions, Peter as director of many major shows. They settled in Dunedin
      in 1979 when Peter was appointed Director of Extension Services at the University of Otago. Both
      became deeply committed to a number of University and community interests: Peter was a long-serving
      board member and Chairman of both the Knox-Salmond College Council and the Fortune Theatre while
      Barbara returned to teaching, served as a Justice of the Peace and was a member of All Saints'
      Vestry, Selwyn College Board of Governors, Otago University Graduates' Association, Otago
      University Staff Wives' Association and the Labour Party. The family moved its base to Vancouver in
      June 1989 when Peter accepted a long-term contract as a senior vice-president in the newly-formed
      Commonwealth of Learning. Barbara and family returned to New Zealand at the end of 1995 and she
      died in 1998, after an eight-year battle with cancer.
