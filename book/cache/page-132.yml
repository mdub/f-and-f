      WILLIAMS, Joseph Heathcote and BUCHANAN, Sarah Nidra (Ally) (cont...)
      "Te Apiti" was divided into two separate properties, "Te Apiti" came into the ownership of Sarah Nidra Williams
      (nee Buchanan) and her daughters, Violet Maud Williams and Norah Williams and "Waipoapoa" became the property
      of Cecil Margaret Williams and Marjorie Williams.
      Rising steeply from the coast north of Kairakau, "Waipoapoa" was originally the western end of "Te Apiti"
      station. It runs up to a plateau at an altitude of 2,000 feet and is well known for its heavy rainfall. The
      name in translation means 'eternal mist'. In 1915 when the Maraetotara Road was extended from Havelock North,
      a woolshed and other buildings were constructed and "Waipoapoa" was farmed as a separate block of 2,500 acres
      on behalf of its owners. When Cecil Williams died in 1965 her half share of the property went to her two
      grandsons, Simon Henry Williams and Robert Euan Williams who sold to the PHM Williams family in 1968. Peter
      William Gerard Williams and his wife, Mary arrived in 1966 to manage the property. Prior to her death in 1970
      Marjorie Mackay had transferred her half share to her sons, Denis Handcock Mackay, Colin Keith Mackay, Brian
      French Mackay and Peter Buchanan Mackay, and the property was farmed as a partnership of the Williams family
      and the Mackay brothers. Over the ensuing years each of the Mackay brothers sold his share to Peter Williams,
      the last sale being in 1991.

      Cricklewood
      Located south-west of Wairoa, "Cricklewood" station was farmed by H L Donnelly from 1895 to 1907 when it was
      sold to William Richmond of Tomoana, Hawkes Bay. At that time about 10,000 acres had been sown in grass and
      about 1,500 acres was still in virgin bush. Richmond held the property for only a year and in 1908 it was
      transferred in equal shares to Mrs Dorothy Wordsworth Sunderland, Violet Maud Williams, Norah Williams, Cecily
      Margaret Williams and Marjorie Williams. In 1911 CM Williams transferred her share to Frederick Wanklyn
      Williams of Napier and Allen Marsh Williams of Te Aute. In 1912 V M Williams transferred her share to Allen
      Douglas Williams of "Clareinch" and Claud Herbert Williams of Muriwai. In 1915 Marjorie Williams transferred
      her share to Arnold Beetham Williams of Waipiro Bay and Edward Heathcote Williams of Hastings. In 1916 Norah,
      Frederick W, Allen M, Arnold B, Edward H and Claud H Williams all transferred their shares to Sarah Nidra
      Williams (nee Buchanan), widow of J H Williams. "Cricklewood" was then owned by SN Williams and D W
      Sutherland and was later sold to Humphrey May Bayley of Gisborne in 1917.
