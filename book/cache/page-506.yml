      where she continued her drama acting in productions by the Karori Dramatic Society, Wellington
      Repertory and by Nola Miller. After her health deteriorated in 1953 she underwent pioneering heart
      surgery by Douglas Robb and Brian Barrett-Boys. On her recovery she renewed her interest in art and
      studied with Barc and later Rachel Miller, who had recently returned from France. This yielded a
      portfolio sufficient to be accepted into a general design course organised by Paul Olds and run at

      Wellington Polytechnic in 1966-68. This included studies in lithography and printmaking under the
      tuition of John Drawbridge and it was here that Penny found her niche. Over the next few years she
      exhibited mainly with the New Zealand Academy, the Antipodes and Brett Duncan Galleries in Wellington
      and the New Vision Gallery in Auckland. She was also a regular contributor to Print Council
      exhibitions which travelled throughout New Zealand and occasionally overseas.
      For much of 1969 and 1970 Penny and Fray were in London and Penny took advantage of the time to study
      lithography at the London City and Guilds Art School. She also furthered her interest in theosophy
      which she shared with Kees and Tina Hos, among others, and which had a profound influence on her
      prints, notably the previously released "Agony of Man" series for which she is well known. On their
      way back to New Zealand they spent time in South Africa and is was from this visit that the "Mating
      Dance" and "Wild and Free" series were derived. The political situation had always been of interest to
      her, but now "Amos and Gerta" and a number of other images including the "Absolam" series were worked
      and reworked,
      To Penny, the prospect of moving to Gisborne in 1976 was inconceivable. She found that exhibiting in
      Wellington, both individually and collectively provided one outlet, and later she secured a QEII grant
      to study printmaking in London and lecture for a short time at the Gippsland Institute in Melbourne.
      Three years before Penny and Fray left Wellington, a group of Gisborne artists had brought an
      exhibition to the city at which they had met Penny and John Drawbridge. Doreen Costello maintained
      contact and, encouraged by a local interest in printmaking, sought a press for Lysnar House. It
      arrived in pieces some months after Penny and Fray were installed in the Waimana Valley, and Penny's
      assistance was indeed useful. About the same time the experience of Bronwyn Holdsworth and Joan
      Sinclair in organising a workshop for potters was soon to be exploited by a group interested in
      printmaking and Waikato University Extension agreed to support it. The workshop, held in October 1976,
      was so successful that printmakers' group was formed within the Gisborne Artists' Society and in 1977
      monthly Sunday workshops were held at Lysnar House. Although the constitution of the group has
      changed, the regime continues today.
      From the beginning, Penny's involvement in the group was pivotal to its success and Gisborne opened
      unforseen opportunities for her. She soon became undeterred by the isolation, although she used to
      hate the drive down the Waimana Valley. She also revelled in country lifestyle, often entertaining
      friends in memorable style.
      In 1983 Penny was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, aggravated by severe arthritis and osteoporosis.
      By 1991 she was unable to print and in 1992 her press was given to Jean Johnston in Gisborne. Since
      then she has drawn stimulation from artists like Grace Manning, working when she could in her studio at
      Waikanae. She has also tried, at times, water colour painting and some work with pastels.
      During the last two or three years, Penny has been unable to create new plates or rub up existing ones
      and in the tradition of many overseas printmakers, Grace and John Drawbridge have done this for her.

      Where possible she has hand coloured and used collage for further develop her images but gradually over
      the past few months, this too has come to an end.
      Among her personal papers there is a note written on a small scrap of paper in red biro: it has no
      origin but simply states that, "if you are given a gift and the intelligence to use it, it is a sin not
      to share it."

      Mangarara
      "Mangarara" was originally taken up as a Small Grazing Run (SGR) and leased from the Crown by Charles
      Gray (husband of Emily Jane Williams). This property, together with "Waiohika", and a third which was
      called "Waihora", constituted his estate when he died in 1918. "Mangarara" had been managed by Olin
      Ormerod since 1927 or 1928 and he and Lucy lived there until Lucy died in 1947. Shortly thereafter the
      property was purchased from Charles Gray's estate by the Ormerod family consisting of Olin, Shirley and
