      WILLIAMS, Wilfrid Gaster and CHALK, Madeline (cont...)
      Rt Rev FA Bennett. The church of St Paul, Putiki was completed and consecrated on 05 December 1937. This
      beautiful church contains a carved canopy over the font in memory of Archdeacon Henry Williams whose visit
      to Putiki in 1839 led to the establishing of a mission station here in 1840. A stained glass window to the
      right of the altar commemorates Canon and Mrs A O Williams.
      Bishop FA Bennett had tested his vocation to the ministry while living with Wilfrid's father in Putiki
      Mission House in 1892-94. Wilfrid played a major part in securing the finances and the establishment of the
      Maori bishopric and was delighted when his lifetime friend, Frederick Bennett, was elected in 1928.
      In 1931 Wlifrid became vicar of the parish of Aramoho, Wanganui. He continued to act as Honorary
      Superintendent of the Maori Mission during the depression years. In 1937 he became Superintendent of the
      Maori Mission in the Waiapu Diocese and moved to Napier. He was made an Honorary Canon of Napier Cathedral.
      For several weeks each year he travelled in the Wellington Diocese exercising oversight of the Maori
      Pastorates there. In addition he acted as vicar of St Augustine's, Napier during the absence of the vicar
      as an Army Chaplain (1941-42).
      In 1946 Wilfrid and Madeline moved to Wellington where he worked for the next five years as Chaplain to the

      Wellington and Hutt Hospitals. He retired in 1951 and was made Canon Emeritus of Wellington Cathedral. In
      1935 he had been awarded the King George V's Silver Jubilee Medal for his services to the Maori people.
      In 1951 Wilfrid and Madeline moved to Hatfield, England where he became senior curate to his son-in-law,
      the Rev Sam Woods. Two years later he died in Charing Cross Hospital, London of a pulmonary embolism
      following a successful hernia operation.

      Madeline was educated at Elmfield House, a boarding school for young ladies at Southwell, England which had
      been founded by Archdeacon Henry Williams's mother, Mary. She was a gifted pianist and linguist. In 1897
      she went to teach English for two years in a German school in Rawitsch in German-occupied Poland.
      Subsequently, until her marriage, she was governess at Cheltenham Girls' College and to children of
      well-to-do cousins.

      Wanganui. Kathleen bd, at Wanganui.
      Maurice was educated at Hurworth Preparatory School, Wanganui and Wanganui Collegiate
      School. Here he excelled at swimming and rowing and he continued to row with the
      Wanganui Rowing Club after he left school in 1931. Because of the depression he had to

      take an uncongenial post as junior clerk in Kempthorne Prosser's town office. In 1937 he
      secured a position as a car salesman with the Merewether Garage. But his heart had always been set on
      flying. New Zealand had no Air Force so in 1935 his father cashed in Maurice's life insurance policy
      and gave him the 400 Pounds to go to England. He joined the RAF as an 'erk' or unqualified airman and
      trained for three years as a bomber pilot. He was commissioned as a Flying Officer in 1939. Along with
      several other New Zealand pilots who had trained in the RAF, he was to return to New Zealand to form
      the nucleus of a Bomber Squadron in the newly-established RNZAF. However, when war with Germany was
      declared they were kept in England 'on loan' to the RAF to form the nucleus of No 75 (NZ) Bomber
      Squadron flying Wellington bombers. Between then and the middle of 1942 Maurice completed 51 bombing
      sorties over Germany. He was awarded the DFC in 1941 and was twice mentioned in despatches for showing
      exceptional skill and courage for carrying out raids in spite of intense enemy anti-aircraft fire. At
      the end of his second series of 'ops' he was assigned to train a number of Czecho-Slovakian airmen as
      bomber pilots. For this he was awarded the Czech War Cross by President (in exile) Benes. On completion
      of his third series of 'ops' he was sent to New Zealand in mid 1942 to take charge of reconnaissance
      flying at RNZAF Headquarters in Auckland. He was joined here by his wife and three year old son. In
      June 1943 he was transferred to Ohakea as Commanding Officer of a Bomber Training Squadron and was
      killed there in a flying accident.
