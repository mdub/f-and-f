      to Henry and William Williams and this may have influenced their decision to settle in Hawkes Bay.
      They were met in Napier by JN Williams and taken by him to "Kereru" Station. In 1864 they purchased "Poporangi",
      an adjoining property and the following year William returned to England to marry Sarah Newcombe Bicknell. In the
      meantime Fred had purchased "Arlington", a 14,000-acre property near Waipukurau from Captain Alfred Newman and
      William and Sarah settled there. In 1869 the brothers purchased the Maungateretere East Block of 2,047 acres near
      Hastings and built their house, known as "The Lawn". The property included a flax swamp and William set up a flax
      mill, intent on exporting flax fibre. However, the market slumped, as did the wool market, and this, along with
      plague of grasshoppers, forced them to surrender the Arlington and Kereru properties to the mortgagee. Leaving
      Fred to run the Maungateretere Block, William took his family back to England and worked again in the gelatine
      business at Warwick.
      In 1880 William returned to New Zealand and he and Fred established the company of Nelson Brothers and Williams
      Ltd, building a plant at Tomoana to can, boil down and treat wool and pelts. When, two years later, the "Dunedin"
      shipped the first cargo of frozen meat to London, Nelson Brothers Ltd was formed in London to take over the assets
      of the canning works and quickly set up a freezing works. The first frozen meat left Napier at the end of 1883. .
      As the new industry developed, the Nelsons began purchasing suitable properties for fattening and soon owned 19
      farms totalling 60,000 acres, as well as holding the lease on "Loch Inver", a 30,000-acre run.
      In 1889-90 they opened works in Gisborne, Waipukurau, Woodville and at Ocean Beach in Southland. The also bought
      their own refrigerated vessel, the "Prince of Wales".
      During their married life, William and Sarah had a family of five sons and four daughters before Sarah's death at
      "The Lawn" in 1883. A year later William married Emma Caroline and they made their home at "Waikoko", a property
      near Tomoana that William bought from Robert Wellwood in 1884.
      In 1882 William was instrumental in establishing Heretaunga School in Hastings. The buildings were moved to
      Havelock North in 1912 and later became Hereworth School. He also set up Woodford House as a boarding school for
      girls. He was involved in the reclamation of Napier South and Nelson Park in Napier was named after him in
      recognition of his enterprise.

      purchased by the Hawkes Bay Agricultural and Pastoral Society in 1933 and is used by it on show days.
