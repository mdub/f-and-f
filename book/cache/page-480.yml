      WATSON, Margaret Jane and PUTT, Colin Kelston (cont...)
      Research Group Manager of ICI's Corporate Research Laboratory at Bozedown House, Whitchurch near
      Reading. From 1980-85 he was ICIANZ's Quarry and Saltfields Manager based at Penrice near Angaston
      in the Barossa Valley of South Australia. After he retired from ICI he spent a couple of years at
      Kaitaia working on the Kaurex project. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chemical Engineers
      (England) and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.
      Colin is a well-known sailor and mountaineer and has participated in a number of expeditions. In
      1961 he led the New Zealand Alpine Club's expedition to the Carstenz Mountains in West New Guinea
      (now West Irian). In 1964-65 he participated in the South Indian Ocean Expedition to Heard Island
      and was one of the party who reached the summit of Big Ben. He has tramped and climbed extensively
      in New Zealand, Australia and Europe. In 1970 he sailed across the North Atlantic to Greenland
      with H W Tilman. In 1984-85 he was ship's engineer with the Project Blizzard expedition which
      sailed to repair Mawson's hut at Commonwealth Bay in the Antarctic. In 1985 he participated in the
      Sarimanok canoe voyage from Bali to Madagascar, though illness forced him to come ashore at the
      Cocos Islands. In 1988 he was ship's engineer (but not one of the climbing party) for the
      Australian Bi-Centennial Expedition which sailed to Cape Hallett in the Antarctic and climbed Mount
      Minto. At present he lectures part-time at Sydney University and also does consulting work.
