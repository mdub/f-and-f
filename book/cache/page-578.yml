      Caroline b. at Epsom. Address: PK 36 Urgup, Nevesehir, Turkey; Email: carolinw@doruk.com.tr.
      After leaving school in 1980, Caroline spent a year working as a Community Service Volunteer with
      old people and handicapped children. The next two years were spent in London working for WH Smith,
      and then the British Medical Association, as an assistant in the Industrial Relations Office. A
      need for dramatic change took her north to the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, where she
      worked as a barmaid at the County Hotel in Stornoway. From 1984-85 she attended the Nicholson
      Institute, Stornoway as a mature student where she gained the three Scottish Highers which enabled
      her to go to University. Her place at Newcastle University was deferred for a year, and she took
      this opportunity to further her travels. Seasonal work enabled her to travel widely and indulge in
      a full season of skiing in Austria.

      While studying anthropology at University, she became fascinated by Sudan, and spent the summer of
      1988 teaching English to university students at Omdurman. She gained her BA (Hons) in Combined
      Studies in 1989. In October, 1989 she took an English Language teaching qualification (RSA TEFL).
      She moved to Istanbul in January, 1990, where she taught English for four years. During her time
      there she began organising and leading bicycle and multi-activity tours and she eventually gave up
      teaching to work in the outdoor activity field full-time. She spent two years in Cappadocia
      leading bike tours, and writing and translating from Turkish to English. In 1996 she returned to
      England and began working as a full-time tour leader for Exodus, with whom she has so far led
      trekking tours in Turkey and Nepal. Caroline's heart is in the mountains and she enjoys all
      outdoor activities, as well as writing, languages and music.
