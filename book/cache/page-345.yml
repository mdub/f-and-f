      ordained in London because he did not have a degree. He went to Australia in 1838 and
      while in Sydney was made deacon. In 1839 he came to New Zealand with Bishop Broughton and became the first priest
      to be ordained in New Zealand. He worked for a while at Waimate North, learning the Maori language, then
      volunteered to go with Tamihana (son of Te Rauparaha) and his cousin, Te WhiWhi, who had come north seeking a
      missionary for the Kapiti Coast. Working from Otaki among the Ngati Toa and the Ngati Raukawa and also from
      Waikanae among the Te Atiawa, Octavius established churches and schools. One of his most notable achievements was
      to plead for peace when, as a result of the Wairau incident in 1843, Te Rauparaha was determined to destroy the
      pakeha settlement at Wellington.
      In 1844 Octavius suffered a complete breakdown in health and for four years he was close to death. But throughout
      his illness he was an influential figure in Wellington, being frequently consulted by Governor George Grey,
      especially on matters of land tenure. In 1849 his health had improved and he returned to Otaki and was appointed
      Archdeacon of Kapiti.
      Octavius was increasingly at odds with Government policy over Maori affairs, and in particular over the war which
      erupted at Waitara in 1860. He was vilified in the press, being described as a 'traitor and a bigoted, meddlesome
      missionary'. However, in the end, even Prime Minister Stafford agreed that Octavius had been proved right.
      When the Diocese of Wellington was formed in 1858 Octavius was offered the bishopric, but declined. When Bishop
      Abraham resigned in 1870, Octavius was again offered the position, and this time he accepted. In 1890 he was
      elected third Anglican Primate of New Zealand, a position he held until his retirement to Marton in 1893.
      Kate lived with her brother, Samuel, in Otaki when he was running the mission station there during Octavius'
      illness.
