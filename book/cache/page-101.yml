      Williams. Harold had built his "Ngamoe" homestead on the property in 1924 when he married. Harold moved to
      Gisborne in 1958 when Colin married, by which time Colin had taken over "Kaharau". It was here that Colin
      established the Kaharau Angus Stud in 1954. An annual sale was held on the property with cattle being sold to
      most cattle breeding countries in the world. In 1991 "Kaharau" was sold and the Angus Stud was moved to
      "Coventry" station, just south of Gisborne.
      Pakihiroa
      In 1897 Thomas Sydney Williams purchased "Pakihiroa" from the Maori owners. Located 18 miles inland from
      Ruatoria in the upper reaches of the Tuparoa Valley, the property comprised approximately 30,000 acres of heavy
      virgin bush - rimu, matai, totara and beech - much of it too rugged and steep to develop, and including the
      mountains, Honokawa and Hikurangi. Nearly 15,000 acres had been developed into grass by 1914 when Thomas lost
      the lease of "Tuparoa".
      "Pakihiroa" was very strong, fertile country with a reliable rainfall and wonderful stock water. It never
      reverted to manuka. Following WWI "Pakihiroa" was subdivided into three separate stations. "Raparapaririki",
      known as "The Rip", was farmed by Oswald Temple Williams, "The Gate" was farmed by Harold Edward Williams on
      his return from the war, and Eva Temple Burnett (nee Williams) farmed "Pakihiroa". The station was to have
      been divided into four but Thomas' youngest son, Colin Sydney Williams, was killed in action in France in 1917.
      In 1963 "Pakihiroa" was bought from Eva and her daughter, Peggie Patience Bannister (nee Burnett), by Colin
      Sydney Wallis Williams and his brother, Peter Wallis Williams.
      In 1969 "The Rip" was purchased by the New Zealand Forest Service for planting, and two years later "The Gate"
      went the same way. "Pakihiroa" was sold to the Crown in 1985 as a prelude to the subsequent return of
      Hikurangi, the Sacred Mountain, to the people of Ngati-porou.

      working on Nelsons' station near Hastings. While there he helped to plant the poplar avenue
      at Pakowhai Road. He came to the East Coast in the early 1900's and worked on the "Matengarika" station
      near Cape Runaway until the property was abandoned. He then went to "Pakira" station as manager. He went to
      Ruatoria in 1920 to manage "Pakihiroa" station for TS Williams and remained there for 20 years until he
      retired to live at "Kaharau", Ruatoria. Burnie was a committee member of the Waiapu Racing Club and a
      founding committee member of the Waiapu Industrial & Pastoral Association. He served on the Waiapu County
      Council, the Tokomaru Bay Harbour Board and the Waiapu Hospital Board.

      Peggie b. at Gisborne and m. at Ruatoria. Martin, s/o James Edgar John Bannister (b. 1871, d. 1946,
      scholar and master at Wanganui Collegiate) and Dorothy Blanche Hursthouse (b. 1895, d. 1938). Martin b.
      at Wanganui. Address: Lake Okareka, Rotorua (postal: Acacia Road, PDC, Rotorua).
      Peggie was educated at Woodford House then worked for a florist for a time. She has devoted the rest
      of her life to raising a family in Rotorua, involving herself in the local community and in a women's
      craft group.
      Martin went to St George's and Wanganui Collegiate School and, by 1941 he had completed Stage 1 of a
      degree in Architecture at Auckland University. He abandoned these studies to join the Navy and saw
      action in the Arctic, Western Mediterranean and Adriatic. On his return to New Zealand Martin undertook
      to study for a forestry degree, but in 1948 was lured away from that to join the Botany Division of the
      DSIR. He graduated MSc at Victoria University in 1950 and after four years in the DSIR, mostly in
      Nelson, he transferred to the Forest Research Institute in Rotorua. He retired in 1982.
