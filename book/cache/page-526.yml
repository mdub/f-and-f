      b. at Takaka, Nelson. Address: 269a Mount Albert Road (PO Box 16-184), Sandringham, Auckland 3.
      Fiona was educated at the Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland and the Auckland Technical Institute
      where she did a one-year secretarial course in 1974. Her first secretarial position was at the
      University of Auckland where she was encouraged to enrol for part-time study. She initially
      studied towards a BA but switched to a BCom which she completed in 1991. The following year she
      completed a Diploma of Commerce. Between 1975 and 1991 Fiona worked at the University of Auckland

      qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1996.

      b 10.09.1957
      Benjamin b. at Hastings. He is severely mentally retarded. He was admitted to Kingseat Hospital in
      1959 and moved from there to Mangere Hospital in 1966. With the health sector reforms that
      resulted in Mangere Hospital being de-gazetted and patients moved to community houses, Ben moved to
      Gilead Farm, Helensville in 1993.
      Gilead Farm is run by the Spectrum Care Trust Board which contracts with the Regional Health
      Authority to provide long-term residential care for people with intellectual disabilities. Clients
      are carefully placed in community houses and are cared for by local residents trained to look after
      them on a rostered basis, 24 hours a day.
      Ben is with about five or six others in a house set on about two acres. He enjoys the space, both
      in the house and its environs. He will stay at Gilead Farm as long as it suits him. He enjoys the
      one-to-one attention that is available and has thrived in the de-institutionalised environment.
      For years family members have been visiting Ben frequently and taking him for walks and drives, for
      both of which he shows eagerness. He has no speech but has some understanding and responds, if he
      so chooses, to suggestions as to what he might do. He can also make his needs known, for example,
      when he wants a cup of tea.
      Ben is an epileptic and has seizures, but otherwise requires no special medical treatment.
