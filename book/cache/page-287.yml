      Erewhon
      Tony's father was born at the Villa Caccia in Florence, Italy, and christened William Charles Birch Caccia.
      His grandfather was Fabio Julian Caccia, descended from the ancient noble family, del Caccia of Asciano in
      Tuscany, Italy, dating from 1012AD. His grandmother was Pauline Birch, elder daughter of William John
      Birch of "Pudlicote" estate in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Pauline's two brothers, Azim and William John
      Birch came to New Zealand in 1860 and leased 120,000 acres bordered by the Rangitikei River in the hill
      country of western Hawkes Bay, from a Maori chief. After ten years, they bought the land and called it
      "Erewhon" after Samuel Butler's book of the same name, meaning 'Nowhere'. Azim and William John Birch
      developed the land into a thriving sheep station, then divided it into two parts, "Erewhon" and
      "Oruamatua". Their 30-year partnership was later dissolved. Azim returned to England, but his son
      Reginald and grandson Jonathan Birch have farmed "Hapua" in the Wairarapa to this day.

      William John had no heirs, so he adopted his nephew, William Charles Birch Caccia, Pauline and Fabio
      Caccia's eldest son, who had come out in 1884 to learn farming. In 1891 William Charles took the name
      Caccia-Birch by deed poll. He took over the running of "Erewhon" in 1897, and his uncle William John
      Birch, retired to Marton, He bought land and built a house called "Thoresby" after a Birch ancestor who
      had lived in South Thoresby, Lincolnshire, UK. "Erewhon" was sold in 1919 but has since changed hands
      several times.
      William Charles Caccia-Birch and his wife Maud retired to Palmerston North in 1921 and bought "Woodhey"
      which the family later presented to the Nation as a war effort after William Charles' death. Maud then
      moved to Marton and built "Guernsey Lodge", where she lived until her death in 1943. Tony and Nancy
      Caccia-Birch then lived at "Guernsey Lodge". Tony still farmed "Thoresby", although the Thoresby House was
      destroyed by fire in 1957.
      "Woodhey" in Palmerston is now owned by the Palmerston North City Council and is maintained as a convention
      centre. It is known as "Caccia-Birch House".
