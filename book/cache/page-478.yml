      part in the running of the blockade to the Southern States during the American Civil
      War. He later joined his brother, Robert, and cousin, Ernest Henry, in pioneering the Hughenden district (named
      after the old family home) in Queensland. He previously married in 1863 to Lucy Sarah Waters who died in 1879.
      Lucy was a talented artist and her account of her arrival at Hughenden is preserved in the Queensland State
      Archives. The climate at Hughenden did not suit his wife's health so he sold out to Robert and moved to New
      Zealand where he purchased "Waiohika" station in 1877. He was very active in local affairs and was a
      foundation member of the Gisborne Club. Grays Bush and Grays Hill in the Gisborne district are both named
      after him.

      Waiohika
      Waiohika, six miles out of Gisborne City, was purchased by Charles Gray in 1877. It comprises 2,008 acres and
      is situated on the northern side of the Poverty Bay flats, off the Waimana Valley Road. About one tenth of the
      land is flat and the rest is hill country. After Charles' death, "Waiohika" was managed by his son Camplin and
      others. The station was auctioned on 14.11.1980 and bought by Mangatu Blocks. It finally passed out of Gray
      ownership on 31.03.1981.
      In the 1920s, Emily employed architect J A Louis Hay (who happened to be her son Camplin's brother-in-law) to
      design a house which was built on a rise overlooking the flats. Louis Hay was strongly influenced by the
      American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the house he designed was reminiscent of Wrights "Prairie Houses"
      (see "New Zealand Architecture" by Peter Shaw, pp 96-97). The former house was demolished and some of the
      materials were used in the construction of the new homestead. The door from the old house can still be seen in
      what was the men's quarters.
      Some time after Emily's death this house and several acres surrounding it were cut off from the rest of the
      property and sold. It is now owned by Mr and Mrs D Witters and has become something of a showpiece.
      "Waihora", 43 km from Gisborne in the Waihora Valley, was also owned by the Gray family. It was sold at the
      same time as "Waiohika".
