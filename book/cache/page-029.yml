      were entitled to an allowance of 2,560
      acres for each son and 1,280 acres for
      each daughter. If this policy had been
      applied the allowances for six sons
      would have been 15,360 acres and for
      five daughters, 6,400 acres - a total of
      21,760 acres. But no such policy was
      ever implemented in New Zealand, so
      that missionaries had to purchase their
      own land. Henry made his first purchase
      from chief Te Marenga in 1833 and his
      final purchase in 1837. The actual area
      of the original purchase is uncertain
      because none of it was surveyed. About
      4,000 acres of it, some of which was
      later returned to the Government, was
      unproductive and was needed in order
      to secure right-of-way to the property.
      The total holdings for which he laid
      claim was 11,000 acres. When the
      Government Land Commission
      investigated his claims in 1841 this total
      was reduced to 7,010 acres. Later, in
      July 1844, Commissioner Fitzgerald
      increased the claim to 9,000 acres and
      this total was approved by Governor
      FitzRoy.

      The missionaries from the Bay of
      Islands wrote to the London
      Headquarters of the CMS in April 1833
      and recommended that an allotment of
      200 acres be given to each child on
      reaching the age of 15 years. The parent
      committee was not happy with this and
      replied in July 1835 suggesting it would
      be more appropriate to make a cash
      provision of £50 for a boy and £40 for a
      girl when they reached 15. They
      assumed that £50 would purchase a
      moderate extent of land but were
      shocked to find that Henry had
      purchased approximately 11,000 acres
      and that other missionaries had
      purchased substantial tracts without any
      reference to them. They had acquired
      approximately 150,000 acres in total for
      which the estimated payment in goods
      was about £8,000.

      Not all missionaries indulged in large
      scale land purchases but some, including
      Ashwell and Octavius Hadfield, were
      critical. Ashwell, writing to A N Brown
      in 1839, said, "I am deeply pained to see
      the buying and selling spirit which has
      crept among us ... is it not true that
      Mammon is the sin of the New Zealand
      mission'. Octavius Hadfield writing to his
      father, also in 1839, said, "The persons
      engaged in the mission are for the most
      part ignorant men who have been
      advanced beyond their proper station in
      life; they likewise, never having possessed
      any property think it very fine to buy large
      estates of land at a very low price and have
      cattle and wheat etc. This grieves me to
      the heart'.

      In view of the forthcoming centenary of the signing of the historic Treaty of Waitangi
      on February 6th 1840 by which New Zealand with the free consent of the Maori
      Chiefs became a British Colony the Committee of the Church Missionary Society
      desire to place on record their deep appreciation of the life and service of the pioneer
      emissary, Archdeacon Henry Williams.
      They gratefully recall the example of this intrepid missionary who with tireless energy
      laboured for forty four years among the Maoris of the North Island without once
      returning to England. They recall his courage and resourcefulness in making peace
      among hostile warring tribes, his fearless stand for truth and fair play between a
      stronger and a weaker race, as well as his gifts both as a pioneer and builder of the
      young Maori Church. Particularly at this historic moment in the life of New Zealand,
      they recollect the notable contribution which his great influence with the Maori
      people enabled him to make in persuading the chiefs to sign the Treaty, the Magna
      Charta of their peoplewhich has ever since remained the basis of citizenship for British
      and Maori alike. They rejoice that he was thus able to fulfill a great mission both as
      a founder of the Maori Church and of the Colony of New Zealand.

      With deep regret they note that historical records show that an unfortunate
      controversy arose between the Society at home and its chief representative in New
      Zealand on the question of purchases of land by the missionaries as a means of
      providing for their children. While allowing for such difficulties as were involved in
      the fact of distance - in those days letters took a year to travel - and in a

      misrepresentation of the facts which misſed the Society as to the real state of affairs,
      the Committee, in the light of present-day knowledge, recognize that the Society was
      mistaken in its judgement and that the charges made against Archdeacon Williams
      were without foundation. They affirm their complete confidence in his integrity and
      sterling character, and deeply regret that any unfounded mistrust of his motives should
      have clouded a period of his long and devoted work among the Maori people. They

      wish to place on record their conviction that New Zealand owes more to him that to
      any other individual missionary, and that his life and service call for the gratitude of
      the whole Church as well as of the Church Missionary Society in whose annals his
      name will always have an honoured place.
