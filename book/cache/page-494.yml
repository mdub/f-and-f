      When war broke out he joined the Army and was posted to the Royal Engineers. With them
      he served in India, first on the North-West Frontier but mainly on the Burma Front, laying out and
      constructing military roads through very difficult landscapes. He attained the rank of Major and was
      awarded the MBE, being also twice mentioned in dispatches.
      Returning to England after the war, he joined Hertfordshire County Council's Architectural Department,
      working on its extensive post-war school expansion programme. He then set up his own architectural
      practice in Bedford Street, London, where he developed a reputation for sound practical design with
      projects completed on time and always within budget. His practice developed into a partnership and
      eventually moved out of central London to Sutton in Surrey.
      Meanwhile he and Christine had moved home to Great Bookham near Leatherhead. Max, after the death of
      his first wife Winifred, had married Christine who was a widow with a son John and a daughter Moira.

      Christine, in their new home, were able to enjoy seeing the three grandchildren as they grew up.
      During the whole of his time in the UK, Max enjoyed an intense passion for gardening where his creative
      skills and considerable technical expertise produced spectacular results which filled every visitor to
