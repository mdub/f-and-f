      MACLEAN, Malcolm James and CAMPBELL, Jennifer Fay (cont...)
      In 1973 Malcolm and Jennifer served with Volunteer Service Abroad for two years in Sarawak and one
      year in Khon Kaen, North East Thailand. In Sarawak Jennie taught at the Junior Secondary School
      for Girls and Malcolm at the Boys' Farm Training Institute. In Thailand Malcolm was in the
      Agriculture Faculty of Khon Kaen University with a United Nations agricultural development team
      whilst Jennie taught English as a second language at Khon Kaen University.
      They then spent a year travelling in Europe and the UK. A visit during this time to Swiss L'Abri
      (the home of Dr Francis and Edith Schaeffer from whose ministry in post-war Europe had grown a

      wide-reaching Christian Fellowship) led Malcolm and Jennie to spend three months at English L'Abri
      in the South of England, led by Schaeffer's daughter Susan and her husband Ranald.
      In 1977 they returned to Pukehou, New Zealand, where Malcolm began working on "Te Aute" Station,
      and on his father's retirement he took over management and part ownership of the farm. Jennie
      began teaching again at various of the neighbouring and Hastings high schools. When the children
      were younger, she took an active part in Playcentre, gaining her Supervisor's Certificate and
      supervising local area playcentres.
      In 1989 "Te Aute" Station was sold, Malcolm and Jennie making the decision to move with their
      family to Auckland. Malcolm returned to University to study Law, graduating LLB(Hons) in 1990 and
      joining the firm of Simpson Grierson where he is now a Senior Associate. During the last five
      years Jennie has returned to teaching at both Epsom Girls' Grammar and Auckland Diocesan School
      where she now teaches English.
      Both Malcolm and Jennie take a full part in the life of St George's Anglican Church in Epsom where
      Malcolm is presently Vicar's Warden and he and Jennie lead a youth group.
