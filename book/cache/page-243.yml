      Waipari Station
      Waipari is part of what was the 21,000 acre Mangakuri Station owned by Archdeacon Sam Williams
      (refer entry for James Nelson Williams in this book, and p 212 of "Samuel Williams of Te Aute" by
      Sybil Woods). The original station extended from Kairakau Beach in the North to almost as far
      south as Pourere Beach. The original 16-stand woolshed built in 1883 is still in use on Waipari.
      The Waipari block of 5,225 acres was split off for Lucy Frances Warren (nee Williams) in the early
      1900s and was later left to Lucy's sons, Alwyn and Greville and farmed by them in partnership. In
      1961, 2,040 acres known as Pukerangi was split off for Greville's family. Waipari is now 1,278 ha
      (3,200 acres) and is owned by the Warren family and farmed by Mark. It is operated as a diverse
      agribusiness, running 10,000 stock units and including 210 ha of forestry. Mark has diversified
      the land use by producing branded bottled mineral water with the plant on site as well as a 4WD
      training course on 20 acres.
