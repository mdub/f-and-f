      Fray in partnership with the Estate of Sydney Gray, one of Lucy's brothers. After Olin's death in 1967
      Shirley and Fray bought the St Gray interest and freeholded the property. "Mangarara" was never a
      'gracious' property and was vulnerable to drought and prone to erosion. With careful management it was
      capable of producing moderate financial rewards. There were, however, better investments available and

      without any younger family members interested in taking over, the sensible thing to do was to sell. In
      the late 1980s forestry interests were becoming quite active in the district. There was intense
      hostility to forestry from many of the older farmers but it had been obvious for many years that large
      parts of "Mangarara" would be better retired from grazing and planted in trees if the soil cover was to
      be preserved. Thus it was that an approach from Fletcher Forests, who by then had acquired a small
      forest estate, had to be taken seriously. A sale was completed in early 1980. Fletcher Forests
      subsequently formed a joint venture company called Hikurangi Forest Farms with Fray's former employers,
      BP (New Zealand ) Ltd. This caused some amusement and possibly a few snide remarks, but Fray was not
      able to say that he had planned it all that way. At the time of the sale the Fletcher's staff involved

      were not aware that BP was a prospective partner in the company.
      Subsequently BP sold it's interest to Fletcher's and more recently, in 1997, Fletcher Forests, having
      acquired substantial forest interests in the central North Island from the Crown, sold in turn to a
      company believed to be Chinese owned. One might wonder what Charles Gray would have thought of these
      developments.

      b 31.01.1946
      Robin b. at London, England. Address: 49 Bombay Street, Ngaio, (PO Box 22082) Wellington.
      Robin moved to New Zealand with her parents in 1948 and was educated in Wellington. Currently she
      is a freelance researcher and writer based in that city. She qualified with a Diploma in
      Journalism in 1968 and spent two years with Sentinel Newspapers working with organisations of all
      types for coverage in their five community newspapers. Subsequently she spent two years with an
      oil company in London, operating an international feature service. Returning to New Zealand, she
      took up a position with Cherrington Public Relations, editing the "New Zealand Economist" and
      "Church and People" before joining the Department of Health in 1973. During late 1976 she was
      seconded to Scott Base in Antarctica for three months as information officer/ photographer. In
      1980 she went to Victoria University to complete a BA, begun at Massey, and subsequently Honours in
      History. Robin then worked in partnership with a fellow student, publishing two short union
      histories.
      For the next twelve years Robin researched, wrote and edited "Antarctic", an international
      quarterly produced for the New Zealand Antarctic Society, and spent a considerable time working on
      a biography due for publication early in 1999. She resigned from "Antarctic" in October 1995 and
      has since been working on a number of organisational histories as well as editing on a freelance
      basis.
