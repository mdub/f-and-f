      Christopher came to New Zealand with his family in 1860 on the SS "Rob Roy". He was
      educated at St John's College, Auckland, then joined the Inspector's Office of the Bank of New Zealand in
      Auckland in 1871. He was subsequently Accountant for that Bank at Napier and then successively agent and
      relieving officer at Russell, Wairoa, Kaikoura South, Rakaia, Foxton, Waipawa and Gore. He was appointed
      Manager of the Palmerston North branch in July 1895 and whilst there he and Ellen were both active members of
      All Saints' Church. Christopher was a member of the vestry and the choir and secretary of the local St
      Barnabas Association while Ellen was described as being 'greatly to the fore in all benevolent works'. When
      they left Christopher was presented by the choir and officers with a handsome pair of carvers 'as a token of
      esteem and affection'. His final posting was as Manager of the Bank at Napier, from which he retired in 1907.
      Ellen became part owner of "Puha Tikotiko" farm near Te Karaka.
      Refer to "The Macleans of Howick and Tamaki" published by Evagean Publishing in 1997 for details of
      Christopher's family.
