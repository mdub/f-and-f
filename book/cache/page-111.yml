      he did not return until the end of the war. He returned to farm "The Gate" station
      and to manage "Kaharau", where he made his home, called "Ngamoe". Harold loved to grow things and the
      magnificent stands of native and exotic trees which surround "Ngamoe" are a fitting memorial to him.
      Nora was educated at Woodford House and after her marriage, was actively involved in community activities
      in Ruatoria. Her father, Arthur Wallis had been responsible for breaking in many thousands of acres of land
      on the East Coast for JN Williams.
      In 1958 Harold and Nora retired to Gisborne where they made their new home on Gaddum's Hill.
