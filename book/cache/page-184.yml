      DAVIES, Edith Race and MILLER, Harold Gladstone (cont...)
      day and study by night. At university she became Women's Vice-President of the Students' Association,
      editor of the literary magazine, "Spike", co-author (with Harold Miller) of a capping extravaganza called
      "Shakleton Out-shacked", and founder of a University Women's Club. On one occasion the feature of the
      evening was a 30-a-side rugby match and an amazing scrum, the players with their long skirts tucked into
      their bloomers! They had locked themselves in the gym so there would be no male intruders, who were, no
      doubt, curious about the shrieks, yells and bumps.
      Her holidays were spent relaxing with cousins in Hawkes Bay or in a painting class with D Richmond. In 1919
      she lectured in English at Victoria University and in 1923, after three years as headmistress of
      Archerfield, Dunedin, she sailed to England, and stayed with her cousin, Mabel's family at Christ Church,
      Oxford. Mabel's husband, Samuel Driver, was Regius professor of Hebrew and Canon of Christchurch. She
      married Harold at Cambourne, Cornwall, and Dorothy Williams (grand-daughter of Samuel Williams) was a
      bridesmaid. After a long honeymoon in Europe, they returned to New Zealand, spent three years in Timaru,
      then in 1928 they returned to Karori where they raised three children, and an enterprising organic garden.
      In the 1950's Edith became a Companion of the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield, England, and in
      the late sixties she was influenced by Charismatic Renewal. She enrolled in the Faith Bible correspondence
      course, "Knowing God in His Word" by Milton Smith, and her Vicar, Edward Norman (later Bishop of
      Wellington) said, "Mrs Miller, if you speak in tongues we will have to get Dr Miller to interpret".
      Harold was educated at Masterton District High School and Victoria University College. He was a Jacob
      Joseph Scholar and a Rhodes Scholar and attended Baliol College, Oxford where he studied in the School of
      Politics, Economics and Philosophy. He graduated MA in Philosophy in 1920 and conferred with an HonLittD at
      Victoria University in 1966.
      Harold was a lecturer at Wellington Teachers' College (1924), Workers' Education Association tutor South
      Canterbury (1925-27), and librarian at Victoria University, Wellington (1928-66). He was awarded a Carnegie
      Fellowship to Ann Arbor University, Michigan in 1931 and in 1962 he was a Visiting Fellow at the Australian
      National University. He was a Fellow of the NZ Library Association (FNZLA).
      He served on the Wellington Diocesan Synod (1944-66) and the General Synod (1951-71). Harold's interests
      shifted to the field of history. In 1958 he spent nine months in Europe, mainly France, furthering his
      interest in the beginnings of Christian civilisation in Western Europe. He had a special interest in the
      early days of European settlement in New Zealand. Because of his special relationship with Edith, he
      changed from being a critic of the Williams family to being one of their most ardent supporters. This led
      to a study of New Zealand missionaries and to his life-long interest in Maori-Pakeha relations.
