      through the Homer Tunnel to Milford Sound. Later he became a tobacco farmer in
      the Nelson district. He was also an accomplished amateur wrestler and a motor cycle racer. In later life
      he also raced motor-cars. He was a keen potter and a talented Maori carver, carving the lectern and stool
      for the Maori Church in Otaki. This lectern was later featured on a postage stamp issued on 23 April 1968,
      in which it was depicted supporting a Maori Bible.
      Rosamond's great grand-father was John Chitty Harper who was the first Bishop of Christchurch between 1856
      and 1889. Her father, Arthur Harper, was educated at Christ's College in New Zealand and Oxford University
      in England, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1888. He was also called to the Bar in New
      Zealand and was awarded the CBE in 1948. He was one of the founders of the New Zealand Alpine Club and in
      later life he was president of the Forest and Bird Protection Society.
      In her early years, Rosamond was a mountain guide at the original Hermitage at Mount Cook. She also made
      the first all-woman ascent of Mount Sefton (10,369 ft) with two other woman climbers on 6 December 1934,
      Rosamond now lives with her daughter, Sue Sutcliff and is still very active, keeping busy with her garden
      and going for walks each day.
