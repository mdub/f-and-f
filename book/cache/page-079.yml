      In 1893 Edward and Jane celebrated their Golden Wedding with an immense family gathering. They both lived to
      celebrate their Diamond Wedding.

      Puketona
      Located about midway between Pakaraka and Paihia, "Puketona" was owned by Edward Marsh Williams some time after
      1842. In 1861 his address was given as "Puketona", so he had built a house there by that time (possibly about
      1855). It is possible that his farming operations did not prosper as the New Zealand Herald of 24 April 1871
      carried a notice of bankruptcy in connection with the Estate of E M Williams, Bay of Islands. In 1887 the property
      was sold to James F Choat.

      Henry b. at Puketona (between Paihia and Pakaraka) and d. at Dunedin.
      Henry trained in surveying and had a family background in administration and law. He is known to
      have been in Poverty Bay in early November 1868 to discuss loan finance (or surveys or
      insurance) with settlers. He rode out from Turanga (now Gisborne) to visit Messrs Dodd and
      Peppard on their run at Repongaere. Their discussion was apparently inconclusive and Henry

      returned to Turanga and took passage to Auckland. A few days later Dodd and Peppard were
      murdered in their home by some of Te Kooti's men on their way to the Poverty Bay Massacre.
      In 1873 the National Insurance Company was founded with its head office in Dunedin and in June 1875 Henry was
      appointed their Auckland manager. He was also active in the Church in Auckland and, in September 1881, he was
      presented with a mantle eight-day clock by Friends of St Sepulchres just prior to his transfer to Dunedin as
      Manager. In 1885 Henry was sent to San Francisco to resolve some problems for the Company and in 1890, by which
      time he was Assistant General Manager, he was sent on a similar mission to London. When he returned he assumed
      the post of General Manager of the Company, and in 1892 this was confirmed. Early in 1914 he intimated to the
      Board that he proposed to retire but, with the outbreak of WW1, his retirement was delayed until the end of
      1918, by which time he was aged 75. Henry had given 43 years service to the National Insurance Company, 26 of
      them as General Manager in Dunedin.
