      WILLIAMS, Henry and COLDHAM, Marianne (cont...)
      forever..." In 1834, in a letter to EG Marsh, Henry reported that he has "succeeded in purchasing, for the benefit
      of the children, a good piece of land as a farm". He continued to add to this first area and the last block was
      bought in 1837. There is no record of the
      area of land purchased during this period as no surveys were taken and boundaries were established by the Maori
      custom of designating distinctive landmarks. However, when the Land Commissioners set about reviewing those
      purchases that had taken place prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, Henry applied for 11,000 acres being
      1,000 acres for each of his children. He had paid for the land mainly in goods and chattels and the Commissioners
      estimated the value of these at Â£1,722. This, according to their formula, entitled him to a claim of 22,131 acres.
      But, in their report of 1844, the Commissioners recommended an award of 7,010 acres. But before the grant could be
      sealed, Governor Hobson died and, following the issue of an amended Ordinance, Henry's grant was reduced to 2,560
      acres. Following the appointment of Governor Fitzroy, some grants, including Henry's, were again reviewed and in
      1845 Henry was awarded an extension of 9,000 acres. In confirming the grant, Fitzroy declared it as "testimony of
      services rendered to the Colony." For the next few years Henry was forced to defend the ownership of his land
      against a series of persistent attacks from those who wished to see him dispossessed. The strongest attacks came
      from Governor Grey who mounted a campaign to persuade Henry to relinquish his land at Pakaraka. In 1847 he was
      joined in this mission by Bishop Selwyn who involved the CMS in the issue. This led to the CMS dismissing Henry
      from their service in 1849.
      At the end of May, 1850 Henry left Paihia with his family and took up residence at "Pakaraka" where he remained
      until his death. Ownership of the land had been transferred to Henry's sons in 1847 and they built him a house
      named "The Retreat", and from a family endowment, built Trinity Church which was dedicated on 23 April 1851.
      The property was designated OLC (for Old Land Claim) 54 on Title Deeds. The "Pouerua" block was taken over by
      Henry Williams jnr about 1847 and the house was built about that time. Edward Marsh Williams, Henry Williams jnr,
      Samuel Williams and John William Williams all worked at "Pakaraka" during the subsequent years. The sons also
      owned a boat called The Children, which traded up and down the coast, until it was wrecked in 1857. In 1855 the
      family were able to buy back from the Government the 4,000 acres which had been deducted from Henry's earlier claim
      by the Land Commissioner. In 1866 Joseph Marsden Williams farmed the 1,100 acre block known as "Ngaheia" and built
      a large home there.
      A description of the area published in 1884 in the Weekly News describes the estate at that time: "We now reach a
      bend in the road, about nine miles from Kawakawa, and open upon the very beautiful and fertile plains of Pakaraka,
      certainly not surpassed in New Zealand. In the distance, guarding, as it were, the plain, rises the extinct
      volcanic hill of Pakaraka, so named by the Maoris from the peculiar nature of the wide crater being lined with a
      dense forest of karaka tree. To the home visitor, the sudden view of the rich plain before him recalls the view of
      some pleasant scene in the old country. Here are three gentlemen's handsome, well-built mansions, with a pretty
      church in the centre, all having the usual adjuncts of our native land - well-fenced, blooming pastures, fine
      gardens, extensive and well-laid-out shrubberies, with groups of well-remembered trees of old England, oak, elm and
      sycamore, whilst round the little church is a fine group of towering willows, gracefully bending their weeping
      foliage over the little graveyard around. These are the residences the Messrs Williams, lords of the soil over
      some thousands of acres."
      During 1886 Thomas Sydney Williams and Henry Edward Williams took over Hansen and Coutts' butchery in Kawakawa and
      supplied meat from "Pakaraka", as a means of selling their produce in a depressed market. In 1891 they tried
      boring for coal.
      When 4,000 acres of the "Pakaraka" Estate was sold in 1893, J W Williams, TS Williams and KS Williams left the
      area. A further block, "Taratara" was sold to Press in 1894 and in 1903 a further 4,000 acres was sold to Arthur
      Close. Two years later the remainder of the Estate was subdivided into farms of between 40 and 400 acres and sold
      by auction. The Homestead, which was used as a school in the early 1900s, was burnt in 1917, leaving the land to
      be sold in 1962 to Philip Poore.
