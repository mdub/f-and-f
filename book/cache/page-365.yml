      they lived in Massey House and managed a property for TC Williams, until Samuel purchased "Tupe Tupe" station from
      his brother-in-law, John William Williams. He built a nine roomed home connected to a smaller house that had been
      moved from "Prospect". He farmed the property until his death, when it was taken over by his son, Henry.

      Tupe Tupe Station
      Originally a part of the "Pakaraka" property purchased by Henry Williams, Tupe Tupe was purchased in 1860 by Samuel
      Blomfield Ludbrook from John William Williams after his marriage to John's sister, Caroline Elizabeth Williams,
      Samuel established Tupe Tupe as a dairy and fat cattle raising farm. The cows were hand-milked and the whole milk

      was left in pans to cool and allow the cream to rise to the top. This was then skimmed off and butter was produced
      in hand operated wooden churns. They used the skimmed milk to rear and fatten pigs. Their produce was transported
      by pack horse and bullock dray to Paihia, a full day's journey, where much of it was sold to visiting whalers and
      trading ships. The fat cattle were driven to Stockyard Bay, Paihia (now Sullivan's Beach) where they were lassoed,
      towed out to trading vessels and hoisted aboard by hand operated slings.
      The farm prospered until the onset of the depression of the late 1870s and early 1880s. During this period the
      barter system came into vogue and their produce was traded with local stores in return for the goods required on
      the farm. At about this time Samuel started farming sheep for their wool. Before shearing the wool had to be
      scoured. Soft soap was rubbed well into the wool of every sheep and they were then made to swim in a nearby creek
      for scouring. Once the wool was dry they were shorn by hand. Initially there was no market for wool in New
      Zealand. It was packed into bags, carried to Paihia and rowed out to trading vessels for export to Australia.
      Samuel's son, Henry Samuel Ludbrook, had been training for a farming career on another Williams property, "Frimley"
      station near Hastings. On the death of his father he returned to Ohaeawai in 1884 and took over the running of
      "Tupe Tupe" for his mother. In the early 1890s he formed a partnership with his brother, William Williams Ludbrook
      and they leased the "Pouerua Estate" from their uncle, Hon Henry Williams when the latter was called to the
      Legislative Council.
      Development on "Tupe Tupe" was boosted at this time by the establishment of the Bay of Islands Dairy Company
      factory at Ohaeawai and by the introduction of home separators and mechanical milking machines. Management of the
      farm was taken over in 1928 by Cecil Edward Blomfield Ludbrook. In 1938 he purchased 900 acres of "Tupe Tupe" and
      purchased the remainder of the land after his father died in 1949. Samuel Blomfield Ludbrook took over the
      "Waikaramu" and "Titirangi" blocks in 1958 and he sold them in 1971 to purchase "Tupe Tupe" and is still farming
      there today. When he married in 1938, Kenneth William Ludbrook bought "Taiamai", a 900 acre section of "Tupe
      Tupe", where he ran a dairy herd and sheep and beef cattle, until he entered the army in 1941, when the dairy herd
      was phased out. After his death the property was farmed by his widow, Barbara Susan Ludbrook (nee Banks), and
      later with their son, William Banks Ludbrook until it was sold in 1972.
