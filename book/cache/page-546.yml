      Vernice spent her early years on a farm near Whangaehu before her family moved to farm in
      Hawkes Bay on land now partly occupied by the township of Waipukurau. She was educated at Chilton House,
      Wellington, then worked in a bank for several years before training as a Karitane nurse.
      Hector and Vernice spent several years at Puha after their marriage before moving to Toromiro, a sheep farm
      on the Whakarai Road, 40 miles from Gisborne. Because of Hector's poor health, they had to leave the farm
      about 1946 and move to Gisborne. There Hector worked for several years in the office of Odlin Timber
      Company.
