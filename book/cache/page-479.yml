      GRAY, Amy Mary and WATSON, Robert Wallis (cont...)
      She also made several overseas trips and travelled widely in England, Europe and Australia, and even
      further afield. In the 1960s she and her friend Phyllis Grahame went walking in Germany, Austria and
      Switzerland, travelling in the Middle East and India, and bike riding around Kathmandu long before it
      became a popular travel destination. She continues to enjoy remarkable health for her age.
      Robert was educated at Christ's College, Christchurch and spent most of his life farming on "Linburn"
      Station. He had a marvellous sense of humour, but he was a very large man, and did not keep good
      health. He died in his early fifties.

      Linburn Station
      Strangely enough, "Linburn" was at one time owned by Charles Gray. However, he sold it to Dods who, in
      1907, sold it to Archie Watson. It was farmed successively by Archie Watson, Robert Watson, then by

      managers for a few years, and then by Gerard Watson, who continues to farm it with the help of his two
      sons, Mark and Timothy.
      "Linburn" is situated some 15 miles out of Gisborne on the Waimata Valley Road. However, because it is
      on the opposite side of the river from the road, it has been quite isolated in the past. The river
      crossing was very unreliable. In 1951 it was only open for six weeks in the whole year and they were
      unable to get their wool out. In the early days, if the crossing was blocked, people had to ride out
      to the road through properties to the south of "Linburn". Later there was a cage across the river for
      a short while and after that a foot swing bridge. In the 1950s and 60s a low level bridge was
      constructed, but it was often blocked by floods. It was not until a high level bridge was built in the
      1980s that access became easy.
      "Linburn" used to have about 1,000 acres in the Waimata catchment and 500 in the Ormond Valley.
      Recently, however, Watsons have bought a property in the Ormond Valley which backs onto "Linburn" and
      complements it.

      Maroubra, then at Hornsby (1957-90) and now on Dangar Island in the Hawkesbury River. The years
      1971-76 were spent in England, living at Reading, Berkshire, and at Goring-on-Thames. During this
      time she undertook historical studies at King's College, London, From 1980-85 she lived in the
      Barossa Valley, South Australia, where she joined the Order of St Luke and became secretary of the
      local branch. Since then she has spent the better part of two years at Kaitaia in North Auckland,
      and is now enjoying life on Dangar Island.
      Jane is interested in the education of handicapped children and was a foundation member of SPELD
      (NSW) and AFASIC (England) and has been the Berkshire County representative to the National Deaf
      Children's Association in London. For the past ten years she has taught Special Religious
      Education at various local primary schools. She has also trained as a counsellor. Her main sport
      is tramping (or bushwalking as it is known in Australia) and she has tramped and climbed in
      Australia, New Zealand, England and Norway. She also sailed across the Tasman from New Zealand to
      Australia with Colin, on the return from his last trip to the Antarctic. Music and reading are
      other interests, and she is at present struggling to develop a large bush garden.
      Colin comes from a pioneering New Zealand family. His great-grandfather, Henry Putt, arrived at
      New Plymouth on the "William Bryan" on 31.03.1841. Colin was educated at St Heliers Primary
      School, King's College, Otahuhu, Auckland University College and Canterbury University College. He
      graduated BSc and BE(Chem) in 1950 and moved to Australia. From 1950 to 1980 he worked for ICI
      Australia at their Botany site, apart from the years 1971-74 which were spent in England as a
