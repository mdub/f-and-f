      McDonald. Comprising some 5,000 acres, it was mortgaged to the Bank of New Zealand which finally bought it in
      1890. In 1894 it was purchased by James Nelson Williams of "Frimley" much as it is today. He first used it as
      a fattening farm for his Waipiro Bay properties. In 1896 it was offered for sale but, there being no takers,
      it was withdrawn two years later. In 1901 James leased "Turihaua" to his son, Heathcote Beetham Williams snr
      who ran it from Hawkes Bay until 1905 when he came to live on the property. He established the, now famous,
      Turihaua Angus Cattle Herd and also a purebred Romney (unregistered) flock which is still going today. He
      completed felling of some of the Puriri bush still standing in 1905.
      On 14 Sep 1942 HB Williams transferred the property to Trusts for his sons, James Nelson Williams and
      Heathcote Beetham (Bill) Williams. James was killed in the war in 1942 and since then the property has
      belonged, through trusts, to several family members.
      Hamish Beetham Nolan Williams has controlled the station since 1986 and, besides continuing the successful
      operation of the Angus Stud, he has introduced a registered Romney Stud. A deer farm has operated since 1980
      under the control of James Nelson Marcus Williams and a small horticultural block adjoining "Turihaua" was
      purchased in 1987.
