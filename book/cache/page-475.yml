      Leonard b. at Paihia, m. in England and d. at Taumata, Napier. He was Bishop of the Waiapu
      Diocese. Sarah, d/o John Bradshaw Wanklyn of Halecat, Westmorland.
      As a teenager Leonard used to accompany his father on some of his many journeys around the
      country, travelling through the bush with the help of Maori guides. In 1847 he was sent to
      England and completed a BA degree with honours at Oxford University. He then offered his

      services to the Church Missionary Society and was admitted to Deacons Orders in May 1853.
      He met Sarah whilst visiting his aunt, Mrs Heathcote, and they sailed for New Zealand in June 1853, shortly after
      their marriage.
      At the time of Sarah's eighth confinement in 1866, there was much unrest among the Maoris caused by Te Kooti and
      his Hau Hau warriors, who at one stage threatened to kill Bishop William Williams. In January of that year William
      and Sarah moved into a small cottage at the foot of Kaiti Hill and close to the mouth of the Turanganui River near
      where the Cook Monument now stands. This was considered to be reasonably safe.
      There was considerable speculation amongst the local Maoris, who were both loyal and friendly, as to whether the
      new child would be a boy or a girl, or even more than one. Maori kuia summed up the situation by saying, "Waikahua
      - Waikatohu". (Who knows? - Who can tell?). Thus when Frank and Sydney were born in December of that year they were
      dubbed by the Maori Waikahua and Waikatohu. The cottage where William and Sarah lived near Gisborne became known as

      Waikahua Cottage.
      Leonard took little part in public life, spending his time in the service of the CMS, mainly among the Maori
      people. He was consecrated 3rd Bishop of Waiapu in 1895 and held the position until 1909.
      Throughout his life Leonard continued to work on the Maori Dictionary producing a 3rd edition which was published
      in London in 1871 and a 4th edition published in Auckland in 1892. This was many times larger and more
      comprehensive than the 1st edition which had been compiled by his father, William at Paihia in 1844. (A 2nd edition
      had been published in London in 1852). In later years Leonard and his son, Herbert worked on a revision, finally
      published by Herbert as the 5th edition in Wellington in 1917.
      Leonard was a keen botanist and acquired considerable knowledge in this field. At Hick's Bay near the East Cape he
      discovered a native broom which was named Carmichaelia Williamsii after him.

      Mangatai
      Comprising 495 hectares, "Mangatai" is located at the junction of the Waipoa and Mangatu Rivers at Whatatutu. It
      was part of the larger holding of Bishop William Leonard Williams, "Mangataikapua", which was cut up during the
      years of World War 1. Several sections were settled by returned soldiers from that war whilst the Homestead was
      retained by the Williams family. During 1989 the property was sold to an outside interest.

      later he entered into partnership with Nathaniel Kettle. In 1891 the business became
      known as Williams & Kettle Ltd and Frederick became Chairman of Directors, a position he held until his
      retirement in 1918 (although he remained a director of the company until his death).
      In association with George Edward Gordon Richardson, Frederick was involved in the founding of the shipping
      company later known as Richardson & Company Ltd, and was Chairman from 1900 to 1940. For over 50 years he was
      a committee member of the Hawkes Bay Permanent Building and Investment Society, and Chairman for 28 years. He
      was also a member of the Napier Harbour Board (1899-1919) and Chairman for a period. He served at various
      times on the Hawkes Bay Agricultural and Pastoral Society, the Hawkes Bay Children's Homes and the Hawkes Bay
      Education (1893-99) and High School Boards. He was elected Mayor of Napier in 1903 and re-elected the
      following year.
      For many years Frederick was trustee of the Foster, Nairn and Makarini Trusts. He took a particular interest
      in church matters holding positions of superintendent of the Sunday School and church warden and vestryman of
      St John's Anglican Church. He was also treasurer of the original Cathedral Building Fund. He was a member of
      the Waiapu Diocesan Synod, of the Auckland and Waiapu Clergy Pension Board and of the St John's College Trust.
      In his younger days, Frederick was one of the original members of the Napier Rowing Club and also a keen rifle
