      brothers travelled by steamer from Opua to Auckland, then on to Onehunga where
      they caught the steamer to New Plymouth, and on by train to Wanganui and Marton, He attended Wanganui
      Collegiate School from 1916 to 1920 and was in the 1st rugby XV and was senior athletics champion. He went
      on to Lincoln Agricultural College during 1921-23 and was in the rugby, cricket and athletics teams and was
      University athletics hurdles champion.
      Cecil returned to Ohaeawai and farmed at Tupe Tupe with his father and brothers until 1928 when he married
      and took over the farm. The Tupe Tupe Estate was run on traditional lines as a sheep and cattle unit.
      During WW2 Cecil was in camp in the Mounted Rifles from 1941 to 1943. After the war he developed several
      blocks of the Estate as fattening units and was an early exponent of the chiller beef market
      Always a keen sportsman, Cecil played representative rugby for the Bay of Islands and for North Auckland,
      and also played county cricket. In the 1930s he became a keen golfer and was later President of the
      Kaikohe Golf Club and the Waitangi Golf Club. He was a keen athlete (sprinter) and also coached boxing.
      In post-war years he ran his horses in many picnic races and show jumping fixtures with Margaret (and later
      Patricia, Elisabeth and Sam) as rider. He and Margaret were foundation members of the Pony Club.
      Margaret was educated at Iona College and Nga Tawa (1921-24). On leaving school, she lived on her parents'
      farm at Otamaraho, Dannevirke. A keen horsewoman, she hunted and rode in shows. The whole family were
      keen tennis players and they had two grass courts. After her marriage in 1928 she moved to the Bay of
      Islands and continued to show horses while raising five children. She and Cecil also had frequent tennis
      parties attended by the many isolated farming families and the young men trying to settle farms in the
      district between the wars. Whilst Cecil was in camp during the war, Margaret ran the farm, and received
      assistance from the Ngati Porou Maori Battalion which was camped on Tupe Tupe. The North was full of
      troops and she extended warm hospitality to the many officers camped at Ohaeawai. After the war she and
      the children rode in many shows and she was a whip for the new hunt.
