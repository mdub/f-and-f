      Brancepeth and Te Parae
      The Beetham family arrived at Wellington at the end of 1855 and two years later they and the Rev Hutton took up the
      lease of a 12,000 acre block of land near Masterton. Following his marriage to Anne Palmer Beetham, Thomas Coldham
      Williams entered a partnership with the Beethams to develop their property. TC (as he was known) provided finance
      to freehold the original block and to develop and expand the area of their holdings. By 1888 the holdings of the
      partnership comprised "Brancepeth" and "Annedale" with a total area of 66,506 acres and running 80,500 head of
      stock. The partnership continued until 1903 when it was broken up in the proportion of two thirds to TC and his
      family and one sixth each to William and Hugh Beetham, TC's share comprised "Annedale", "Kumukumu", "Te Parae",
      "Mamaku", "Rawhiti", "Poroporo", "Patukawa" and "Longridge". This he divided amongst his thirteen children, with
      his sons receiving equal amounts, which were one-quarter greater than those received by his daughters. Hugh George

      Williams inherited "Kumukumu" and appointed Bernard Westmorland as manager. The property subsequently went to his
      sons, Garthowen Williams and Morvyn (Tim) Williams. Garth had little interest in farming and his share was bought
      by Tim, who also purchased "Ngatawhai" station. The property is now owned by Philippa Therese Williams (nee
      Riddiford). Algar Temple Williams inherited "Longridge" and sold it out of the family shortly afterwards.
      "Mamaku" was taken over by Erl Temple Williams and later passed to his son, Peter Temple Williams. "Annedale" was
      bequeathed to TC's five daughters, Elfie Clare Williams, Maude Mary Anne Williams, Hilda Temple Williams, Eila
      Mabel Williams and Una Mildred Williams. Shortly after WW2 approx 14,000 acres of "Annedale" was acquired by the
      Government under the Rehabilitation Scheme. The homestead block comprising approx 3,300 acres was later sold to
      James William Blyth, "Rawhiti" (1,200 acres) went to Ethel Alice Russell (nee Williams) and Enid Githa Fergusson
      (nee Williams) received "Patukawa" (1,000 acres). Guy Coldham Williams inherited "Te Parae" and then leased both
      "Patukawa" and "Rawhiti" from his sisters. Guy's elder daughter, Barbara Hope Deans (nee Williams) inherited
      "Katatane" station and his younger daughter Joan Elfie Dillon inherited "Wiremu".
      Te Parae" was later taken over by Alister Coldham Williams and he also purchased "Potaerau" near Masterton, which
      he renamed "Little Avondale". These properties are now farmed in partnership by his sons, Thomas Coldham Williams
      and Richard Alister Williams. After the war "Patukawa" was sold for Rehab settlement.

      Manako
      Thomas Coldham Williams bought up land at Kerikeri in the early 1890s through to 1899, and farmed sheep and cattle
      on 10,000 acres known as the "Manako Estate". It eventually comprised all the land south and west of the Waipapa
      River, apart from small areas of the Mission Station and others on the Kerikeri inlet down to the Oakura inlet.
      The Oakura River was its southern boundary and it extended west to approximately the present position of State
      Highway 1. TC Williams carried on the practice of planting gorse in rows, harvesting when young and chaffing for
      stock feed. He also grew turnips, swedes, oats and grasses in rotation. The property was managed by Cecil Kemp
      from "The Homestead" until it was sold in 1910 to H L Bull. It was purchased by George Riddell in 1914 when it was
      subdivided and sold in sections.
