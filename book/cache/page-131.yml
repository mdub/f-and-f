      Te Apiti
      Originally of 14,500 acres, "Te Apiti" station lies towards the coast a few miles north-west of Kairakau in
      Hawkes Bay. The property was purchased in 1878 by the Beetham brothers, George, Charles and Norman and was
      managed by Norman for some 18 years. In 1896 the Beethams were joined in partnership by Joseph Heathcote
      Williams who took over the supervision of the property from his home at Havelock North. He appointed Claud
      Herbert Williams as manager and he held the position until 1907. By 1908 J H Williams had completed the
      acquisition of "Te Apiti" from the Beethams. Following his sudden death in 1910 the property was run under the
      trusteeship of Allen Marsh Williams of Te Aute and Frederick Wanklyn Williams of Napier. It was managed by
      Charles Pattison then e Pierce until Richard Sunderland took over in 1916. At that time the Maori leases
      expired and blocks known as "Waimoana", "Kapiti" and "Kokatawai" were relinquished. The remaining freehold was
      subdivided into two properties, "Te Apiti" of 3,600 acres and "Waipoapoa" of 2,400 acres. Richard Sunderland
      continued to run both properties until 1950 when Paul Henry Metcalfe Williams took over the supervision of
      "Waipoapoa" and "Te Apiti" was taken over by Joe Langdale Sunderland who ran it until his death in 1979. When
