      Dorothy Mercy Milner, b. at Putaruru. Address: Piringa, 7 Huntly Road, Campbell's Bay, Auckland.
      Beatrice was educated at Diocesan High School, Whangarei Girls' High School and Otago University (Dip
      HSc, Dip Dietetics). She was Senior Dietician at the National Women's Hospital, Auckland. She is a
      member of the Vestry, CAB, Home Science Alumnae, Deer Farmers' Association, South Devon Association,
      Federation of University Women and the Grange and North Shore Golf Clubs.
      Murray, MBChB, BSc, was a general practitioner at Mangere for 30 years where he was the founding
      Chairman of the Mangere Health Centre and involved with teaching medical students from the Auckland
      School of Medicine. In 1967, in partnership with Beatrice, he bought their first sheep and beef
      property at the Houtu in Northland. This was sold in 1970 when a larger property, "Pukenui", was
      bought at Kaiwaka. They spent 20 years developing this mainly sheep and beef unit, extending into deer
      farming in 1981 when their eldest son, Tony, straight from Lincoln College where he graduated BAgCom,
      became manager of "Pukenui". In 1984, when Murray retired from general practice in Mangere, he and
      Beatrice moved to "Pukenui" where they farmed with Tony and wife Sally until 1989 when "Pukenui" was
      sold to a businessman from Switzerland. Tony and Sally bought "Winderemere" at Kereru while Beatrice
      and Murray moved to Campbell's Bay in Auckland where they continue their interest in deer farming by
      grazing stock on Tony's and Sally's farm at Kereru.
      Murray is a member of the NZMA, New Zealand Deer Farmers' Association, New Zealand South Devon Society,
      the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, North Shore Golf Club, and the East Coast Bays Probus Club.
