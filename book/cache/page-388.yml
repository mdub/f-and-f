      John b. at Auckland. Mary, d/o Dr Harry and Freda Wilson of Hastings. John and Mary are both bd. at Taupo
      Cemetery.
      As a young man, John was given Â£5 and sent off to seek his fortune. He worked for 18 months at the Bank of
      New South Wales in Auckland before deciding that farming was his vocation. He started as a shepherd on the
      East Coast and it was whilst there that he met Mary, marrying her after a five-year courtship. Mary had
      been educated at Woodford House and Nga Tawa Schools.
      In 1938 John was appointed manager of "Monowai" station at Te Kuiti for the National Bank of New Zealand.
      In 1942 the bank totally financed John and Mary onto "Monowai" and they farmed there until retiring to
      Taupo. John was a member of the Electoral College Committee of the New Zealand Meat and Wool Board for six
      years and a vice-president of the Meat and Wool Section of the Waikato Federated Farmers, and was also a
      director of AFFCO. He represented the East Coast and Hawkes Bay at rugby.

      John b. at Te Kuiti and m. at Hamilton. Rosanne, d/o SF (Tom) Bull and Irene Stewart. Address:
      Hamilton.
      John grew up and farmed in the Te Kuiti area and received his secondary education at Wanganui
      Collegiate School. After a stint on an East Coast Station, he farmed on three different properties on
      Troopers Road, Te Kuiti. Initially he leased 300 acres, then, in 1971, he and Rosanne purchased
      "Pukearahi", a 500-acre hill-county property and for ten years they expended much energy on its
      development. This property was sold in 1981 to buy 500 acres of easier land on the Ludbrook's original
      "Monowai" farm. They farmed there for five years, converting half the property into a dairy unit.
      John later worked in real estate in Hamilton where he remarried. He is now retired and enjoys
      interests such as pottery and gardening.
      Rosanne was raised at Te Akau and educated at Waikato Diocesan School. She graduated BA from Waikato
