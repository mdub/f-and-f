      Ruth b. at Eversley. Following a trip to Europe in the 1920's where she met leading anthroposophists, Ruth
      was instrumental in the development of the movement in New Zealand and it became her lifelong interest. In
      1946 Ruth, with her sister, Gwen, purchased "Kereru" station which had at one time belonged to their
      grandfather, JN Williams, and under their ownership it became one of the leading pastoral properties in
      Hawkes Bay. In 1966 Ruth and Gwen each formed their share of the station into a charitable trust which
      continues to support a range of activities.
      Ruth was largely responsible for the establishment of the Rudolph Steiner School in Hastings. In 1950 she
      and others bought the then Queenswood School for this purpose.
      Ruth also carved the altar in the Woodford House Chapel at Havelock North.
