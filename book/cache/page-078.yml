      na deacon by Bishop Selwyn on 11.06.1843 and moved to Kaikohe Mission Station in 1845. He
      retired to Waimate in 1854.
      Edward came to Paihia, Bay of Islands in August 1823 with his missionary parents. He was educated by them and later
      at the Mission School, Waimate North. He returned to England on HMS "Buffalo" in 1834 to complete his education. He
      became seriously ill in 1839 and was sent back to New Zealand. With his brother, Samuel, he took over the
      management of the family farm at Pakaraka. He became a brilliant Maori linguist and an expert in the Ngapuhi
      dialect. In February 1840 he assisted his father to translate the Treaty of Waitangi into Maori. Later that year he
      sailed on HMS "Herald" (under Captain Nias) with Major Bunbury of the 80th Regiment, on a voyage to southern Maori
      districts where he acted as official interpreter of the Treaty to Maori chiefs. The signatures of the chiefs were
      witnessed by these three men in Coromandel Harbour, Mercury Bay, Cloudy Bay (near Blenheim), Otakou (Otago), the
      island of Ruapuke in Fouveaux Strait, Kapiti Island and Hawke's Bay. On this voyage Major Bunbury raised the
      British flag and declared sovereignty over the South Island in Cloudy Bay on 17 June 1840 and in Stewart Island
      later that same month.
      In July 1841 Edward was appointed as a Director of the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd, opened in New Zealand in
      1840. Later he and Jane settled on part of the family farm at Puketona. The house they built is still lived in
      today. He took services regularly at Pakaraka and frequently acted as mediator between Maori tribes and between

      1861. He administered the Runanga (Maori court) system with great skill and fairness (refer "A Show of Fairness" by
      Dr Alan Ward, pp 137-140) and promoted the establishment of Maori village schools. In 1881 he was appointed a Judge
      of the Native Land Court and moved to Auckland. He retired in the late 1880's and moved to Pukehou, Hawkes Bay
      where his brother, Samuel, had built a house for him called "Roxton". Here he translated more than 200 A&M hymns
