      GRAY, Douglas Wanklyn and HALL, Emma Millicent (cont...)
      New Zealand. He continued to fly, giving joy rides and flying some of the first air mails. After their
      marriage Douglas and Emma went to live at Arero for a time so that he could learn about farming from his
      uncle, Frank Williams. He then purchased "Glenwai", a farm of 1,400 acres in the Wairarapa, 18 miles SE
      from Pongaroa, The family stayed there until 1946 when they took over half of Wilfred Hall's property at
      Hororata in Canterbury, after his death. The house on this property was known as "Gunyah" although the
      farm, of 1,500 acres, was known at this time as "Farfield". It was a small part of the original "Terrace"
      station which had been owned by Wilfred Hall's father, Sir John Hall. Douglas took an active interest in
      public life, being a member of the Akitio County Council for some years before moving south. He was also
      active in Federated Farmers in Pongaroa and Dannevirke. He later became President of the North Canterbury
      branch of Federated Farmers and was a member of the Marginal Lands Board.

      Farfield
      The "Terrace" station at Hororata in Canterbury was first taken up by Sir John Hall and the portion called
      "Farfield" later passed to his son, Wilfred Hall. "Farfield" comprises 1,500 acres and was taken over by
      Douglas Wanklyn and Emma Millicent Gray in 1946 (Emma was the daughter of Wilfred Hall). The homestead on
      the property, built by Wilfred, was known as "Gunyah". In 1962 a third of the farm, later known as
      "Taitua", was leased by Fabian Douglas Hall (Tim) Gray. After the death of his father Tim acquired
      ownership of the remaining two thirds and moved with his family to "Gunyah". "Taitua" went to his sister,
      Ann Julia Newman (nee Gray). Since Tim's death in 1990 both properties have been sold and "Gunyah" is now
      run as a guest house with a small piece of land.

      She did some nursing at Christchurch Hospital then turned her attention to
      music. She worked at various jobs while taking lessons in singing and performing in that art. She spent
      two years in London (1949-51) working and studying singing then returned to New Zealand, spending two
      years in Christchurch. This was followed by three years in Sydney, Australia where she sang in radio
      broadcasts, concerts and stage shows. She returned to Christchurch for a further two years then went to
      Canada for a 'quick tour' and remained to marry. This ended her singing career but in 1981 it was been
      revived in a small way by joining the Vancouver Bach Choir. She retired from the choir in July 1997
      and is now pursuing an interest in photography.
      Harold has practised law in Vancouver and for two years (1978-79) he was a lecturer in law at Victoria
      University in Wellington. He is now a judge of the Appeal Court of British Columbia in Vancouver.
