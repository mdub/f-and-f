      WILLIAMS, Norah and SUNDERLAND, Richard (cont...)
      worked for him used to call him "The General". Richard was taught by a governess for a few years then went
      to Heretaunga School in Hastings and Wanganui Collegiate School. His parents' marriage broke up when he
      was 15% and he then rode down from Poverty Bay to Tomoana, Hastings, leading a packhorse with all his
      worldly possessions. In 1895 he started work for William Nelson, but under Mr Tane the farm manager. He
      finally left Nelson's employ as farm manager of "Hukanui" at Puketitiri in about 1910 and bought a half
      bush farm near Makakaho up the Waitotara River west of Wanganui. He then went into partnership (for Â£1,000
      and he did the work) at Pareroa, behind "Blackhead" station and at the end of the Long Range Road,
      Waipukurau. When he married in 1916 he was offered the job by the trustees of managing "Te Apiti" station,
      Otane.
      For the rest of his life Richard farmed hill country in Hawke's Bay. In 1925 he and Norah built
      "Undercliff" beside the Tuki Tuki River at Te Mata, Havelock North but continued to oversee "Te Apiti" and
      "Waipoapoa". Later he also oversaw "Pukeatua" near Dannevirke for his Norah's sister Maud (Bersch) until
      it was taken in 1945 for rehabilitation of returned servicemen.
