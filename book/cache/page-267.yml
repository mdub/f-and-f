      Algar b. at Wellington and m, at St Michael and All Angels' Church, Christchurch, Janet b, at Otaio, South
      Canterbury.
      Algar was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School (1889-95, prefect, rower). He farmed in the Wairarapa then was
      a tea planter in Ceylon for some years. During WW1 he served overseas as a Lieutenant with the New Zealand
      Field Artillery and was ADC to General Sir Andrew Russell. After the war he was a stockbroker in Wellington for
      some years before retiring to Christchurch. He designed and built a beautiful garden at Fernside near
      Featherston, where he was business adviser to the owner, Mrs Elgar.
      Early research on the life of Henry Williams had been undertaken by Hilda Temple Williams with the help of her
      cousin, Henry (Hal) Williams. After Hilda's death in 1939 Algar took over the research and copied by hand many
      hundreds of Henry Williams' letters. Both originals and copies are now deposited in the Auckland Museum. These
      early records were the source of "Journals of Henry Williams", 1961 and "The Life of Henry Williams", 1972 both
      written by Lawrence Rogers of Tauranga.
