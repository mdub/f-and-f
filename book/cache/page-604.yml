      school he gained practical farming experience at "Thungia" Station and
      Turanganui Romney Stud before purchasing "Maungaorangi" Station, 50 minutes north of Gisborne. He
      farmed and developed the property for 18 years before selling. In 1986 he moved with his family to
      "Turihaua" Station to run the property for family members. He also supervises "Ohinewairau" Station, a
      family property in Taihape, and is a director for Williams and Kettle and for several family companies.
      The Angus Stud is his passion and he enjoys the challenge that the stud stock industry demands. He
      maintains a keen interest in the sheep, deer and bloodstock industries. He is a strong believer in
      'sustainable farming practices' and has established plantings of various tree species for land erosion,
      timber and fodder crops.
      Hamish is involved in the Farm Cadet Scheme (now known as AITO), and with the New Zealand Beef Council
      at a local level. He is also a Councillor for the New Zealand Angus Association.
      Angela was educated at Woodford House and is a qualified speech and language therapist. She is
      directly involved in farming affairs and the Stud and is actively involved in the education of their
      three children.
