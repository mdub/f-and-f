      DAVIES, George Henry and GODFREY, Rose Alma (cont...)
      George was recognised as a poet, raconteur and wit and an enthusiastic follower of rugby football. He was also
      reputed to know the entire history of the Welsh Fusiliers off by heart. The Free Lance recorded that when Wales
      defeated the All Blacks in 1905 he drew a widely-circulated cartoon of the Billy-Goat of Wales knocking out the
      Moa of New Zealand. The picture carried the caption, "Nec moa terrent" (not even the moas alarm us); giving a
      new twist to the motto of the Welsh Fusiliers, "Nec aspera terrent" (not even difficulties frighten us).
      Rose was actively involved in the affairs of St Mary's Church, Karori.
