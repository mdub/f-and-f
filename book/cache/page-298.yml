      Williams, was a cousin to Ken. Ken was educated at Heretaunga School and Christ's
      College (1884-88). He played for three years in the 1st rugby XV and was captain in
      1888, and was also in the 1st cricket XI. Ken arrived on the East Coast in 1894 and
      farmed sheep and cattle at "Matahiia", Ruatoria. In the early years of Wwi Ken, along

      with TS, HB and AB Williams, formed and financed the Waiapu Trust with the
      intention of financing the settlement of returned servicemen on the land. The Trust purchased the
      Whakaangiangi Block not far from Ruatoria and a number of ex-servicemen, selected by ballot, settled there,
      with the provision that repayment of advances made to these men should be used to benefit others less
      fortunate. Ken also personally financially assisted a significant number of men, both Maori and Pakeha, in the
      years following WW1. A fluent speaker of the Maori language, Ken was keenly interested in, and highly esteemed
      by, the Maori of Ngatiporou.
      Ken was chairman of the Waiapu County Council and a member of the Tokomaru Harbour Board and the Waiapu
      Hospital Board, He won five elections, three of them unopposed, as Bay of Plenty Member of Parliament
      (1920-35) and was Minister of Public Works (1926-28). He was awarded the King's Jubilee Medal in 1935. Ken
      was a Poverty Bay rugby representative in 1903.
      Lillian took little part in community affairs, but had a deep faith in God and was always a regular church
      attender. She was also a gracious hostess and welcomed a continuous stream of visitors at "Matahiia". She was
      a prolific letter writer and kept in regular contact with her constantly expanding extended family until she
      was well into her eighties.

      Waiapu district. Included was the "Matahiia" Block. Francis James Kemp came from the Bay of Islands to manage
      it, and in 1885 he married Samuel's niece, Marianne Elizabeth Georgina Hutton. From 1886 to 1898, "Matahiia",
      along with other Williams properties, was administered by Mr A H Wallis who lived at Waipiro Bay. In 1892
      Samuel Williams was in debt on the property and so he brought his two nephews, Thomas
      Sydney Williams and Kenneth Stuart Williams, from the Bay of Islands. He offered them the chance to start off
      on some land on their own account if they could clear the debt.
      In the 1880s Samuel built a kauri woolshed on "Matahiia". It had twenty stands and held 1300 ewes and 1500
      lambs in the night pens. It had a large wool floor capable of holding enough bales for three to six horse
      wagons. At this time the wool was carted to "Tupuroa" where it was shipped by surfboat out to coastal
      steamers. Sheep from much of the surrounding country were brought to "Matahiia" to be shorn - up to 60,000
      sheep in a peak year. In 1897 ten machine stands were installed.
      "Mokoiwi" which adjoined the back of "Matahiia" went to Gerard Temple Williams, and when he died on a hospital
      ship at Gallipoli, his sister, Sarah Catherine (Kitty) Taplin, sister of KS Williams, took over "Mokoiwi". In
      1917 "Matahiia" was offered to the Government for soldier settlement but the erosion problem meant that it was
      considered unsuitable. In 1918 Kenneth Stuart Williams gave his wagoner, Jimmy Arnold, a section of land, and
      he also gave his plowman, "Nob' Walter Cousins, some land comprising 250 acres of flat and 150 acres of hill.
      Eventually the Taplins took over Cousins' farm, which the Government bought and subsequently leased and called
      it "Mangarewarewa". After the Taplins died, this property was bought by John William Stuart Williams, elder
      son of John Dow Williams, who was Charles Kenneth Williams' younger brother. In 1924 the management of
      "Matahiia" was taken over by Charles Kenneth Williams, the eldest son of KS Williams.
      In 1938 the old homestead was burnt down by a fencer on the property. CK Williams built a new homestead on a
      different site, and a smaller house was built in the old gardens for Kenneth's widow, Lillian Mary Williams.
      Until 1932 the only access to "Matahiia" was across the Mata River, subject to heavy flooding. In 1957 the
      last of the waterways were bridged giving almost all weather access after 74 years of ownership. In 1950
      Kenneth Sydney Williams, eldest son of CK Williams took over stock management on "Matahiia".
      In 1960 the two brothers, Charles and John, agreed to divide "Matahiia" and John called his block "Taitai"
      station, which was subsequently taken over by his elder son, Stuart, in 1971. Kenneth Sydney then took over
      full management of "Matahiia‚Äù. In 1963 CK and Phyllis Williams moved to Gisborne and Ken and his wife, Jose,
      and their five children moved into the Matahiia homestead. "Matahiia" is now managed by Ken and Jose's two
      sons, Jeremy Kenneth Williams and Timothy Charles Bentham Williams.
      The "Matahiia" Partnership has purchased two soldier settlement farms in the valley in the last ten years and
