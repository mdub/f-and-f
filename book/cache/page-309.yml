      Hal b. at Pakaraka. He was educated at Christ's College (1885-90). In 1892 he went to
      London to study engineering and qualified as MIMeche and MIEE.
      He was articled to Sir Frederick Bramwell and Graham Harris, Consulting Engineers, of
      London in 1893, and on completion of his articles in 1897 received his practical
      training with Messrs Haslam and Co of Derby. In the following year he returned to

      Bramwell and Harris as their principal assistant, and remained with them until 1900.
      He then entered into partnership with Professor Henry Adams, practising as Adams and Williams until 1903 when
      he joined with Walter Ridgesunder under the title, Hal Williams and Bridges. In 1910 he established the firm of
      Hal Williams and Co. He became a specialist in the design of cold storage and refrigeration installations. In
      addition he designed many large factories and, for WW1, a hospital at Hampstead.
      He planned the refrigeration section of the New Zealand exhibit at the Wembley Exhibition. This featured a
      glass fronted freezer containing frozen exhibits. At the time this was thought to be technically impossible.
      Later he designed the New Zealand Pavilion at the Glasgow Exhibition.
      During WWI Hal was one of the prime movers in the creation of the British sugar beet industry and designed and
      built factories at Newark, Ely, Ipswich and Kelham in Nottinghamshire. During WW2 these factories kept Britain
      supplied with sugar.
      In an article in the "Cold Storage and Produce Review" (April 1923) Hal laid stress on the deficiencies in
      methods of handling meat in the UK after it was landed from overseas liners. At a time when New Zealand farmers
      were involved in developing the frozen meat trade to Britain, his comments make interesting reading. He quoted
