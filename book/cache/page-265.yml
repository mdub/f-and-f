      University. He graduated LLB (New Zealand) and LLB (Cambridge). He was President
      of the Cambridge University Law Society and was called to the English Bar (Lincoln's Inn) in 1939. He
      started work as a prosecutor for the Motor Trade Association in Birmingham. When war was declared he
      received an immediate commission in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and was posted to Iraq. Promoted to
      lieutenant-colonel in 1944, he became assistant director of ordnance services to the 8th Indian Division as
      it made its way up Italy. He was appointed MBE(Military) in 1945. He entered the Colonial Legal Service
      in 1946 and served in Nigeria as Magistrate (1946-51); Chief Magistrate (1951-55); Chief Registrar of the
      High Court of the Northern Region (1955-56); Judge of the High Court of the Northern Region (1956-63);
      Senior Puisne Judge of the High Court of the Northern Region (1963-68) and Chief Justice of the Northern
      States (1968-75). After independence in 1960, Nigel helped to train barristers at Ahmadu Bello University,
      and offered guidance when they went into practice. He was appointed CBE in 1967 and knighted on the
      recommendation of the Nigerian Government in 1970. In retirement he, along with two others, acted as
      Commissioner for Law Revision in the States of North Nigeria, a gargantuan task which entailed the complete
      revision of 50 volumes of laws of 1,000 pages each, which had not been reviewed since 1963. As a result,
      Northern Nigeria has some of the most up-to-date laws in Africa.
      Elizabeth was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge (Double First in Modern and Medieval Languages, 1937)
      and was a linguist with the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park (1939-45).

      Extracts from Obituary published by the Daily Telegraph, UK.
      Reed was a tall, distinguished-looking New Zealander whose fine manners, robust common sense and manifest
      honesty earned him the Hausa nickname, "dan Kirki" - "Excellent Upright One".
      Before independence in 1960, Northern Nigeria's High Court functioned in parallel with the Sharia Court -
      which dealt with Muslim laws dating back to the arrival of the Emirs in the Middle Ages. Reed was in the
      thick of efforts to consolidate the two codes in the run-up to self-government.

      Mindful of the need to satisfy Northern Nigeria's tough and charismatic Muslim premier, the Sardauna of
      Sokoto, he was more ready to compromise than some of his colleagues.
      As Nigeria moved towards independence, opposition to the Sardauna was growing in the Christian and pagan
      south. It was a tribute to Reed's standing that the Sardauna accepted without demur Reed's acquittal of
      his rival, the leader of the Tiv tribe, on charges of treason.
      Reed stayed put after the coup of 1966, when the Sardauna and many of Northern Nigeria's senior officers
      and politicians were assassinated. In the resulting vacuum, he and his fellow judges were a crucial
      stabilising influence, especially during the Biafran Civil War, which began in 1967."
