      WILLIAMS, Caroline Marsh and MORA. Georges (cont...)
      first individual exhibition from Melbourne University to tour Australia (1997-99). Her works are
      represented in public and private collections in Australasia, the United States and Europe. In 1986
      she was guest curator of The Male Sensibility at the Museum of Modern Art at Heide, Melbourne. Her
      publications include "Saints", 1980, Bergstrom and Boyle, London, and St Martins Press, New York; "The
      Independence of Memory", 1996, Robert Lindsay Gallery, Melbourne; and various articles and pamphlets.
      There are references to her work in numerous publications concerning art and culture in Australasia and
      Europe, mainly during the 1980s and 1990s.
      Georges was educated at Leipzig and spent a year at the Berlin University, Faculty of Medicine, before
      leaving for Paris, France, when the Nazis came to power. As a Jewish refugee in Paris, he worked for
      his mentor, Monsieur Trilling, the impressario who was a publisher, concert organiser, translator,
      businessman, inventor and patent dealer. This training prepared him for his future career as a key
      catalyst in the Australian culture of the 1950s through until his death in 1992.
      In 1936 Georges fought with the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War and was imprisoned in
      Spain. At the outbreak of war in 1939 he was imprisoned by the French as a German alien, then
      released. He joined the French Foreign Legion and when the French army was disbanded he travelled from
      North Africa to Marseilles and there joined the Resistance. He fought in the Resistance until the fall
      of Paris, his main activity being the smuggling of Jewish children over the borders of Spain and
      Switzerland. He was wounded twice.
      After the war, Georges worked for OSEA, the organisation which reunited displace Jewish children with
      their families. When this operation was completed, he returned to patent dealing. He was made a
      citizen of France.
      In 1951 he emigrated to Australia with his first family and settled in Melbourne where he proceeded to
      change the face of restaurants and eating habits. He also played pivotal roles in the establishment of
      the Museum of Modern Art and in the Commercial Dealers Association. He started the Balzac and Tolarno
      Restaurants and also the Tolarno Galleries, all three becoming landmark establishments. He was also a
      public voice for racial equality, frequently writing and speaking on issues of racism. He became an
      Australian citizen.
      Georges changed how Melbournians, and in turn, Australians, understood and ate food. He also brought
      to Melbourne, key figures of the art world and international art exhibitions while at the same time
      influencing Australian artists and the art profession so that they started to think of themselves in
      terms of a world standard of practice. In doing this he created a change in the cultural climate. In
      1988 he was made a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres. There are references to his activities in
      most publications concerning life and culture in Australia, especially Melbourne, during the 1950s thru
      1990s.
