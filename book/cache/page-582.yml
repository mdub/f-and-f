      coast at Anaura Bay inland to the Hikuwai River, and 5,000 acres of Maori leaseholding which ran up the coast
      towards Tokomaru Bay. Like most Maori leases in those days, it was not renewable and when it ran out in the
      early 1900s, Frank Williams bought a 5,000 acre block from the Fitzgerald Brothers inland from Tolaga Bay, thus
      restoring the station to its original size. Frank and his family lived in the homestead at Anaura Bay until
      1938 when a flash flood made the manager's house unsafe. The manager moved into the homestead and Edith
      Williams and her daughter, Jane moved to Hastings. A manager ran the property from then until it was sold to R
      R Shanks in 1956.
      "Waipare" was situated on marginal land and about 20% of its area was, and still is, totally unproductive. In
      1966 Bob Shanks sold it to the Government for re-settlement but, due to the unsuitable nature of the country
      this did not occur and the property is now leased to a forestry company and most of it has been planted in pine
      trees. Shanks retained the homestead and about 15 acres of land which was next to the beach.
