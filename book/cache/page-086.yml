      Edward b. at Gisborne. Divorced. Nancy, d/o David Anderson and Agnes Bowman.
      Edward was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School and spent the early part of his career on "Coventry"
      where he introduced diversifications such as maize crops to the successful sheep station. In 1957 he
      moved to Rotorua to set up business rewinding motors. In 1959, in partnership with Rod Belerby, he
      harnessed Rotorua's thermal energy to develop Puhutu Mushroom farm. He left the partnership in 1968 to
      establish Lakeside Mushroom farm, and retired from there in 1991. Edward's skill as an engineer enabled
      him to carry out on-site development and prototype construction of his own inventions, some of which
      are currently patented. Edward was an active member of the Rotorua Tramping and Skiing Club, and was
      its president in 1966.

      Derek was educated at Rosmini College and Auckland University. He completed his ATCL, LTCL and
      L.Mus. TCL diplomas in piano and composition and is a Fellow of Trinity, London. He graduated to the
      degree of Bachelor of Music at the Auckland University Conservatorium of Music, winning several
      academic awards before going on to lecture and examine there. As a student, he toured the world as
      a chorister and pianist with the Auckland University Festival Choir which performed in the
      International Choral Festival at the Kennedy Centre and in the White House, Washington DC, and at
      the Lincoln Centre, New York, as guests of the US Government, and then at King's College, Cambridge
      and Westminster Abbey, London. He founded the New Zealand School of Music and, with the conductor
      of the Symphonia of Auckland, established the first non-university tertiary level qualification for
      conductors of music in the Southern Hemisphere. He completed his NZ Education Department Diploma in
      Teaching, and while teaching, was a musical director for several theatrical productions, and worked
      professionally as a computer programmer of educational software for New Zealand schools. He was
      employed as a keyboards player by Sir Howard Morrison.
      Derek was approved as musical director and orchestrator for the world premiere production and cast
      album of the musical, "Aloha", by the authors, Sir Robert Helpmann and Eaton Magoon Jr from Hawaii.
      He was later flown to Honolulu to work as arranger, computer programmer and production adviser for
      a Broadway musical of Magoon's. After musically directing a professional New Zealand production for
      Broadway director, Joe Layton, he emigrated to Australia where he gained work variously as a
      musical director for Australia's Wonderland, keyboards player for "Cats", and orchestrator for the
      Australian Singing Competition. He was later employed as chorus master for a major Sydney musical,
      "Rasputin". He was choral arranger and pianist for Torvill and Dean on their Australian album,
      "Here we Stand".
      Derek has continued as a computer programmer and teacher, and is an HSC examiner for the NSW Board
      of Studies. He is a freelance keyboards player for theatre productions, has played live in
      television performances, and is orchestrator and orchestral conductor for many Australian film and
      television productions. He is currently orchestrating "Frauds", a feature film starring Phil
      Collins. He is employed as a critic and record reviewer for a number of newspapers and magazines,
      and is an office-bearer in a number of organisations within Sydney's gay and lesbian community.
