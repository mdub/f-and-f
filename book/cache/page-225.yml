      Samuel b. at Hampstead, England and d. at Te Aute. Mary, d/o William Williams and Jane
      Neslon,
      Samuel was educated at the mission schools at Paihia and Waimate. In 1836 he took over his
      father's farm at Pakaraka until 1844 when he entered St John's College, Waimate, to
      prepare for holy orders. When the college moved to Tamaki he became senior bursar and

      assisted with the administration of the College farm and finances. He was ordained deacon
      in 1846, ten days before his marriage. In 1847 Samuel was appointed to take charge of the Otaki mission during the
      illness of Octavius Hadfield. There he organised an extensive educational establishment including boarding
      accommodation for 100 Maori boys, and a mission farm.
      Impressed with his work at Otaki, Samuel was requested by Governor Grey to set up a Maori school in Hawke's Bay.
      The move to Te Aute took place in 1854. An estate comprising some 7,000 acres was created from Government grants
      and land donated by Te Hapuku and others, and entrusted to the Bishop of New Zealand. The administration of the
      estate was vested in a board of trustees with Samuel being given power of attorney. The school was opened in 1854

      with twelve pupils, but closed again in 1859 due to shortage of funds, and the effects of a ruinous fire. Samuel
      then concentrated on developing the farm to provide a permanent source of income with which to assist with the
      funding of the school. During the early 1860s, using his own funds, then borrowing heavily, he cleared and fenced
      the land, and increased stock numbers. In 1869 Samuel sought to retain control over the management of the estate by
      leasing it from the trust. The lease was renewed in 1878, 1892 and 1903 with appropriate increases in rental, but
      Samuel was forced to defend his position against those who criticised the granting of private leases over
      educational trust land. However his stewardship was subsequently vindicated by a Royal Commission held in 1906.
      The College reopened in 1872 and concentrated on developing a high level of academic instruction. Samuel also
      played a role in the establishment of a Maori girls' school at Hukarere, Napier in 1875.
      Samuel was a fluent Maori speaker and wide knowledge of Maori culture. He had respect for their customs and a
      sympathy with their aspirations and fought tirelessly for their rights and their advancement. During the Hauhau
      uprising he challenged their beliefs in open debate and provided a stabilising influence on the unsettled Maori
      community of the time.
      To his family, Samuel is remembered as a benefactor who guided and assisted many of his relatives in the purchase
      and establishment of pastoral holdings in the Hawke's Bay and East Coast districts. When he died in 1907 he left an
      estate valued at 429,566 Pounds.

      was getting the "Wairakaia" station established when Te Kooti escaped from the Chatham Islands and landed on 10
      July 1868 at Whareongaonga about 9 km south of Johnson's home. By the time of his death about 1898, Johnson had
      freeholded an area in excess of 10,000 acres most of which was broken in and farmed. In about 1904 his trustees
      (Johnson's brother, Randall and Cyril White who was the grandfather of June Katherine White, wife of Philip James
      Murphy) offered "Wairakaia" for sale (part of the property, including Young Nick's Head, had been sold earlier).
      On the instigation of Archdeacon Samuel Williams, the property was inspected by his wife's nephew, Heathcote
      Beetham Williams and purchased for subdivision. Claud Herbert Williams bought "Coventry" and his brother, Henry
      Carleton Williams took the next block, "Sherwood". The adjoining block to the south was purchased by Muriel
      Buchanan Faulkner (nee Williams) and retained the name, "Wairakaia" and her husband, Albert Joseph Faulkner took
      the next block which became known as "Waihina". The fifth block was taken over by Gerald Kemp who was head
      shepherd at Te Aute and a family friend and was named "Maraetaha".
      In 1983 "Coventry" was subdivided between Kenneth Christopher Dodgshun, his son, David Christopher Dodgshun and the
      remainder was retained by the family of Claud Herbert Williams. In 1989 this part was bought by Colin Sydney

      Wallis Williams when he moved his Kaharau Angus Stud from Ruatoria.
      In 1946 Terence Leslie Carleton Williams became a partner in "Sherwood" and in 1977 this block was subdivided
      between his sons Andrew Carleton (Dan) Williams, Timothy Nolan Williams, retaining the name of "Sherwood" and John
      Terence Williams who named his block "Puta Awa".
      "Wairakaia" was taken over by Frederick Edward Faulkner and passed on in turn to his son, Rodney George Faulkner,
