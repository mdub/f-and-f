      him. He joined the 1st Pembroke Yeomanry and saw 3 years active service as O/C No 5 Light Car Patrol in the
      Egyptian Desert. He drove Model T Ford cars which, despite (or because of) their spidery appearance, easily
      outperformed their rival Rolls-Royce and opposing FIAT cars in the desert. He designed, but failed to
      patent, a radiator water recovery device that extended their desert range considerably.
      Partly because of frustration at the lack of military opportunity, Claud was led to undertake a detailed
      survey of routes, vital water sources and topographical features of the NW Desert of Egypt. He compiled all
      of this in great detail into a book which was subsequently published in heavily classified form by and for
      the British Army. During WW2 this information, to which the Axis forces were not privy, played a pivotal
      role in the marauding activities of the Long Range Desert Group as well as in General Wavell's attack on
      Benghazi and General Montgomery's strategy which effectively forced Rommel into retreat and later, rout.
      Claud held the rank of Captain and was awarded the Military Cross with Bar and the Order of the Nile. He
      earned a DSO but that award was only available to Majors and above. He later compiled a full manuscript of
      his life in the desert as a narrative for publication, It presented this period as the all-time highlight
      of his life and as a deeply satisfying experience. In his later years he was disappointed at his inability
      to have it published other than by funding it outright, but perhaps he failed to realise that there was a
      surfeit of such books available at the time.
      After demobilisation he resumed farming with his brother, Carleton, Perhaps the ultimate measure of his
      success was the establishment, in coordination with Chris Dodgshun as manager, of a Perendale stud flock at
      "Coventry". Over these years Claud held various public offices. As a President of the Sheepowners'
      Federation, he was involved in the amalgamation with the Farmers Union to form the Federated Farmers in
      1945.
      Claud and Lesley were both musical, he playing the violin and she the piano. They retired in 1960 to live
      at 22 Haronga Road, Gisborne.
