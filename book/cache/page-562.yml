      Mark b. at Te Puia Springs and m, at Gisborne. Angela, d/o Neil Ralph Funnell and Stephanie Anne
      Forbes Orsler, b. at Gisborne. Address: Ruangarehu Station, RD 1, Tokomaru Bay.
      Mark was educated at Hereworth School (1971-73) and Wanganui Collegiate School (1974-77). He
      gained a DipAg at Lincoln College in 1981 and a Certificate in Farm Management (NZ Trades
      Certification Board, 1987). In 1981 he was accepted on the Minnesota International Student-Trainee
      Agricultural Exchange Program through the University of Minnesota in the USA. That involved
      spending two years in America, living and working on farms in Minnesota, Montana, and Oregon, and
      also spending the 1981-82 winter quarter at the university as a student. In July 1986 he returned
      to Ruangarehu to help his father and took over management in 1990. Not having the resources to buy
      out the other family members, "Ruangarehu" was sold in September 1996 to forestry interests and
      Mark and Angela are currently grazing it until it gets planted in 2000.
      Angela was educated at Manutahi Primary School and Napier Girls' High School. In 1997 they
      purchased a house in Gisborne and moved there in 1998, nearer to a school and a kindergarten, to
      start educating their children,
