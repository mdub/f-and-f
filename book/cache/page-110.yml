      Airhill
      "Airhill" is situated on Highway 50 about 40 km south west of Hastings, between Maraekakaho and
      Tikokino. Originally part of "Maraekakaho" station, a 1,500 acre block of regrowth scrub was
      bought by Oswald Nelson about 1925. It was taken over by his son, Punch Nelson after WW2 and from
      1970 to 1981 it was farmed in partnership by Paul Sunderland Nelson and his brother, Sam. The
      property was then divided into two blocks, Paul taking "Airhill" of 286 hectares where he now runs
      sheep and cattle with a small thoroughbred stud.
