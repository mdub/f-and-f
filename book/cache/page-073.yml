      - of his brother-in-law, Rev E G Marsh of the Church Missionary Society. In 1820 he moved
      to Hampstead to study for Holy Orders and was ordained in June, 1822. Later that year he left with Marianne and
      their three children on the convict ship Lord Sidmouth, spent several months in Sydney, then continued on to New
      Zealand on the Brampton, arriving at the Bay of Islands on 03 August 1823.
      Henry assumed leadership of the New Zealand Mission and for the next 17 years he directed the steady extension of
      Christian influence amongst the Maoris. Shortly after his arrival he built a raupo church, the first in New
      Zealand, at Paihia. This was replaced by a lath and plaster building in 1827 and by a wooden church in 1856, The
      present Church of St Paul was built by the Williams family in 1923 on the site of the original raupo chapel as a
      memorial to the work of Henry and his brother, William.
      Conversions were slow in the earlier years of the Mission. Warfare amongst the Maori tribes was rife and the sale
      of firearms was instrumental in making the conflicts particularly bloody. Henry devoted enormous energy to the

      mediation of differences and by persuasion and courage he was often able to bring a peace, or at least a temporary
      truce. Known as Te Wiremu, he gained the deep respect of many of the Maori chiefs and, over time, had a
      considerable influence on their activities.
      In 1826 Henry built a 55 ton schooner, the Herald, to enable him the better to provision the mission station and to

      more easily visit the more remote areas of New Zealand. She was wrecked in 1828 near the Hokianga Heads. During
      the 1830s new mission stations were established at Tauranga, Rotorua, Waikato and Otaki and Henry travelled widely
      in order to minister to them. In 1839 he sailed by schooner with Octavius Hadfield to set up the Otaki mission and
      on the way they sought shelter at Port Nicholson where he met Edward Gibbon Wakefield. He visited Te Rauparaha on
      Kapiti island and then travelled overland by foot to Tauranga.
      When Captain Hobson arrived in New Zealand in 1840 Henry played a pivotal role in persuading the Maori chiefs of
      the northern districts to sign the Treaty of Waitangi and he later travelled throughout the North Island explaining
      the Treaty and obtaining additional signatures.
      Following the establishment of British rule, Henry's advice and assistance was sought by Governor Fitzroy and by
      Bishop Selwyn who installed him as Archdeacon of Waimate in 1844, Sir George Grey, however, was jealous of Henry's
      influence amongst the Maoris and proceeded over the next few years to undermine his position and publicly discredit
      him. To provide for the future of his children, Henry had purchased 11,000 acres of land at Pakaraka and this
      became the focus of charges by Grey and others that Henry was involved in land speculation. He was dismissed by
      the Church Missionary Society in 1849 and he and Marianne left Paihia to live at Pakaraka where his sons were
      farming. Here he built a church and continued to minister to his very large following of Maori adherents. In 1854
      he was reinstated by the CMS but remained at Pakaraka.
      In his final hours, Henry learned of a bitter dispute between two local tribes over the possession of an old pa.

      He sent his son, Edward to intervene but fighting continued until the warring parties learnt of Henry's death. A
      truce was declared and the two sides subsequently made a lasting peace.
      Before their departure for New Zealand, Marianne trained as a maternity nurse and studied the Moravian Methods of
      teaching and Organisation. She played a leading role in the establishment and running of the mission schools and
      provided care and comfort for those of the mission who suffered illness.

      Pakaraka
      From the early 1830s Henry Williams began providing for the future of his children by purchasing land. In a
      country with few opportunities for employment, farming was the one avenue available to the children of settlers.
      In 1833 Henry made his first purchase of land at Pakaraka from his friend, Te Morenga of Taimai who stated in the
