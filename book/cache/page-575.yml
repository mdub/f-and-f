      Edinburgh, gaining his rugby blue in each year and playing first class tennis at which he won
      several trophies. He qualified as a medical doctor and worked initially at the Middlesex and Brompton Hospitals
      in London before signing on for a while as a ship's doctor with the New Zealand Shipping Co. After this he
      joined a private practice in Harrow which included two of the houses of Harrow School. He was Harrow Police
      Surgeon and was largely responsible for the initiative to build Harrow Cottage Hospital on Roxeth Hill. In 1918
      he gave up general practice and transferred to the Military Pension Department of the War Office, working first
      in Lancashire and Cheshire and then in Brighton. He moved to Roffey near Horsham in 1923.
      He was an authority on New Zealand flora, of which he had a fine collection at his home in Roffey, and he
      contributed regularly to gardening journals. He was the author of a book entitled "New Zealand and Her Plants".
      His abiding passion, however, was breeding roses. He was on the Council of the National Rose Society for many
      years and was President in 1933/34. His two most successful roses were Emily Gray (1916) named after his eldest
      sister and Blushing Lucy (1938) named after his wife, Emily Gray is commercially available and Blushing Lucy
      has survived by the efforts of his descendants and now graces the gardens of many friends.
