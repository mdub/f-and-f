      Fray b. at Gisborne and m. in London. Penny, d/o Edward Montague Moneypenny and Hannah Fairweather, b.
      in South Africa. Address: PO Box 203, Waikanae 6454.
      Fray was educated by correspondence and at Wanganui Collegiate School from 1935 to 1938. In his last
      year he was a prefect in Harvey House. In 1939 he took a position as a junior master at Waihi School
      in South Canterbury as an intermission before moving on to University. With indications that war was
      coming, this may not have been the most appropriate advice, but perhaps that year contributed to a
      better result in the end. Most of 1940 was spent at Victoria University College in Wellington and
      towards the end of that year he enlisted in the RNZAF. He was not called up until June of 1941 and in
      August he sailed with a large contingent for Canada and joined the Empire Air Training Scheme.
      His group reached England in February of 1942 and in September he and his crew were posted to No 75(NZ)
      Squadron a unit of No 3 Group RAF Bomber Command, In May of the following year they were one of the
      first three crews to complete a tour of operations in that interval of eight months. In that time the
      squadron had lost a total of twenty eight other crews of which a small number of individuals survived
      as prisoners and an even smaller number successfully evaded and returned to England. In February 1944
      Fray returned to No 75 Squadron in an executive capacity and flew on another eighteen operations with
      ten different crews. By this time the survival rate was much improved but after the War 75 was
      estimated to have suffered heavier losses than any other squadron in the whole of Bomber Command,
      except for one. At the end of the war Fray held the rank of Squadron Leader, had been awarded the DFC
      and been Mentioned in Dispatches.
      After the War Fray looked for employment in England because his lack of qualifications and the
      uncertain prospects at home made return to New Zealand rather speculative. He flew with what is now
      British Airways on flying boats between UK and Singapore for a year, but a high tone deafness
      attributed to war-time flying threatened the renewal of his licence and he was forced to resign. He
      secured a position with Vickers Armstrong but shortly afterward was offered a Short Service commission
      with the RNZAF. Since this provided him with secure employment prospects in New Zealand and an
      opportunity to get his wife and daughter out of England, it was accepted. Two years into that
      engagement he was offered a permanent commission but once again his hearing disability prevented him
      from pursuing this. The RNZAF agreed to release him at his discretion and he cast about for other
      opportunities.
      At about this time the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now known as BP, had formed a joint venture company
      with the New Zealand Government and was recruiting staff. Fray applied to them and was accepted. He
      joined in 1949 and served with the Company in Gisborne, Wellington, Christchurch and London. By 1970
      he was Assistant General Manager and after five years in that position he assessed that further
      advancement was problematical and invoked a clause in his contract which allowed him to take early
      retirement at the age of 55.
      In early 1976 Fray and Penny built an additional house on "Mangarara" Station and moved up there to
      live. In 1977 Fray was elected to the Cook County Council, and in 1980 was elected Chairman. It would
      be true to say that coming from a commercial background he found much that he believed could be changed
      for the better. Naturally these views were not universally accepted and he was strongly challenged in
      1983. Rather than face the prospect of presiding over what was likely to be a divided council, he
      withdrew his nomination and two years later resigned in his third term prior to moving to Waikanae
      where he and Penny now live.
      Penny was educated at Girls' High School in Pretoria and when her parents and sister Frankie moved to
      England in 1938 she remained in South Africa to study art and drama. She joined her family in England
      in 1941. After a short spell as VAD, she joined the WAAF, training near Lossiemouth in the north of
      Scotland. In 1943 she was posted as a Sergeant to the RAF station at Meepal in East Anglia and it was
      there that she met and married Fray. After moving to Gisborne, Penny found limited opportunities to
      pursue her interest in art so she turned her attention to drama, taking leading roles in various
      productions by Gisborne Repertory and in many play readings. In 1952 the family moved to Wellington
