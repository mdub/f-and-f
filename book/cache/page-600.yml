      James went to Turanga with his parents as an toddler, in 1839, and attended St John's
      College in Auckland in 1846-48. He accompanied his parents to England in 1850-53. As a young man James was in
      charge of the farming work at the Waerenga-a-Hika Mission. He went to Hawkes Bay in 1857, and after a short period
      with Samuel Williams at Te Aute, he took up "Kereru" station. In 1864 he bought and moved to Frimley where he
      built his home. His developments here played a major part in the growth of Hastings. Dissatisfied with the poor
      soil, JN sold "Kereru" and in 1875 bought the "Apley" portion of Rissington, some 15,000 acres, which he
      subdivided, selling off farms in 1879 when he bought "Edenham". Already in 1876 he had purchased "Mangakuri" which
      was passed to Samuel Williams. A journey of exploration of the northern East Coast region in 1883 led to the
      development of the Waipiro Lease.
      JN was behind many business ventures for the development of Hawkes Bay: there were attempts to establish a harbour
      at Clifton, a steamship company, goldmining and a woollen mill. More successful were the Northern Investment
      Company of New Zealand, and his partnership with William Nelson in what became the Tomoana Freezing Works. He
      served on the Hawkes Bay County Council for its first 24 years, the Napier Harbour Board, the Hospital Board and
      the Acclimatisation Society. He donated a ward to the Napier Hospital. He was involved in timber milling ventures
      in Queensland, in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne and near the main trunk railway south of Taumarunui.
      JN's granddaughter Bettie has written, "Though we went often to Frimley, children in those days were kept much in
      their nurseries and he seemed a kindly, but remote figure. Occasionally I sat on his knee and played with his watch
      and chain. Such a large expanse of waistcoat that I was hardly aware of the bearded face above it. I remember
      being taken to see him at Rouncil shortly before his death and being much upset when he died."

      Kereru
      Adjoining the Ruahine foothills west of Hastings, "Kereru" comprised some 20,000 acres of a purchase by the Crown
      in 1857 from Te Hapuku. It included the properties later known as "Big Hill" and "Whanahahana". James Nelson

      Williams held it from 1857 until 1875, and lived there until his move to "Frimley" in 1864. From 1865 until 1873
      he was in partnership with Colonel J L Herrick, who lived there between 1864 and 1869. By the time the property
      was sold the sheep flock numbered 22,000. For several years the property was managed by Allen Marsh Williams
      before he left to manage. "Te Aute". After World War 2 the sisters, Alice Ruth Nelson and Winifred Gwendoline
      Maiden (nee Nelson), purchased "Kereru" and, on their deaths, bequeathed the station as an educational trust.

      Frimley
      Originally 3,000 acres in a north-south strip, "Frimley" comprised two of the twelve sections (hence Hawkes Bay's
      'Twelve Apostles") of the "Heretaunga" block. This block was first leased by James Nelson Williams from the chief,
      Takamoana Karaitiana and from Henare Tomoana in 1864. The lease was made official in 1867 and the block was
      freeholded, not without much pressure on the owners, in 1870. Validation of the purchase took 25 years, became a
      political football and involved expensive court judgements. Kay Mooney, Hawkes Bay County historian, says, "The
      Angel Gabriel would have to apply to his superior before he could make moral judgements on it. (Part 2, p 19). The
      property was managed for about twenty years (1887-1907) by Joseph Heathcote Williams.
      "Frimley" was bounded on the east by Thomas Tanner's "Riverslea", and included most of the north and west (the
      Mahora-Stortford Lodge areas) of modern Hastings. Much was swamp land which was drained by Irish labour, fenced
      and sold off in 200-acre lots. Following an exploratory trip to Britain, France and North America in 1890, JN

      Williams established an orchard on a co-operative basis around the site of the Hastings Hospital. Later he also
      introduced pea growing. In 1904 Hawkes Bay's first canning factory was installed in the "Frimley" woolshed. In
      1958 the remaining acreage was gifted to the people of Hastings and is now known as Frimley Park.

      Apley
      "Apley" was part of "Rissington" station west of Napier, owned by Major General Hon Sir George Stoddard Whitmore.
      Comprising 15,000 acres of freehold, it was purchased by W T Buckland in 1873. A year later the land plus 9,000
      sheep was purchased by James Nelson Williams from the proceeds of the sale of "Kereru". He sold the property in
      smaller lots in 1879.
