      In 1893 Francis James Kemp took up the "Rotokautuku" block at Ruatoria. It comprised 1,596 acres leased at 1/6
      per acre, plus some freehold. The lease was renewed for a further 21 years at 5/- per acre. On the retirement
      of FJ Kemp the property passed to Ralph Kemp and Athol Lewis Kemp who farmed it in partnership for a time,
      then divided it into two separate units,

      Rukuhanga
      In 1909 Francis James Kemp took up a block of 1,532 acres of virgin bush land near Cape Runaway about 80 miles
      north-east of Opotiki. His two sons, Alfred Ernest Kemp and Hayward Francis Kemp, with the help of their
      cousin, AJ W Kemp, cleared the bush and drained and swamp-ploughed a 200 acre block which they used to produce
      crops of rape, maize and turnips. They established a herd of Aberdeen cattle from stock from HB Williams'
      "Turihaua" stud and also a Romney flock from the stud of Sir Edwin Mitchelson and later from the Patutahi Stud
      of Mr A Kirkpatrick of Gisborne.
      "Rukuhanga" was freeholded about 1922 and in 1950 H F Kemp, having no children, sold his share to his nephew,
      Frank James Kemp. The property is now owned and farmed by Frank's son, James Ernest Kemp.
