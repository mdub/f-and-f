      in 1937 where he caught the largest blue marlin ever caught in the Bay of Plenty.
      He visited Germany on many occasions and travelled in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. He acted as a courier
      on ecumenical work, particularly with the German Lutheran Church. Through this he helped a number of
      pastors and persecuted people out of Nazi Germany.
      Derrick was ordained on 06 October 1940 by the Bishop of London, in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral; the
      "All Clear" was sounded just before the service began. He served as a curate at Hayes, Middlesex during
      1940 then tried working in engineering as a worker priest. He was awarded the Bishop of London's prize for
      conducting services. He served under Fr St John Groser in Stepney, London in early 1941 during the Blitz.
      The family lived first at 20 Carlton Avenue, Hayes, then Stepney, then moved to 43 Temple Sheen Road in
      late 1941.
      Derrick joined HM Forces and trained as a commando but was assigned to the Royal Army Chaplain's Department
      when it was discovered that he was ordained. He was attached as a Chaplain to No 45 RM Commandos for the
      D-Day landing. The Commandos were attacking Ouistreham on the Eastern flank on 5th June, the eve of D-Day
      and Derrick was killed in the action. He is buried in the military section of the Southampton Cemetery.
      Anne's father was killed on 06 November 1916 in the Battle of the Somme and she was sent to a boarding
      school at age five. She wanted to be a surgeon and, while nursing at age 17, she caught typhoid and was
      unable to continue. She trained as a secretary and worked in connection with the League of Nations and also
      for Christian Howard (now Dame Christian) at Castle Howard, Yorkshire. Following her marriage she assisted
      with parish work including work in the shelters and underground.
      On Derrick's joining up she went to live at the Gate House Castle Howard, returning to Sheen after his
      death. She moved to Dorset in 1951. She started theological studies under Evelyn Underhill at King's
      College, London and involved herself in many voluntary activities. She was secretary of the Music Club,
      assisted with Diocesan Moral Welfare and founded the Bridport Film Society, and was a founder member of the

      West Bay Association.
      She was an accomplished embroiderer and a founder member of the West Country embroiderers Association. She
      assisted many churches, including Salisbury Cathedral, with embroidery, both new and restoration. She
      taught embroidery and wrote a book entitled "The Batsford Embroidery Course" (ISBN 0-7134-6479-8 published
      by Batsford, 1991). She studied successfully for an Open University Degree and took a Post Graduate degree
      in Education at Loughborough to teach fine arts.
      Anne travelled extensively visiting New Zealand in 1967-68 and making two trips to China, the first to the
      South and the second along the Silk Road to Kashgar.
