      On leaving school he worked on three well-known properties on the East Coast before returning to "Matahiia"
      Station to help his brother Charles with the management of the property. After his marriage to Nancy, they
      lived at "Matahiia" until 1945, raising two sons and two daughters. John took a keen interest in district
      affairs and held senior office in many organisations. He and Nancy were tireless workers for the war
      effort, supporting many patriotic shop days, Although he moved to near Gisborne, John continued to

      maintain a major interest in "Matahiia" Station. After their move they developed a new home and started a
      citrus orchard on a section of Nancy's inheritance. John served as an Anglican Church Synodsman and was
      involved in the planning and building of Te Wiremu House. He was chairman of the National Party which
      elected Mrs Esme Tombleson in 1960. Their new home was called "Okaihau" and was situated at Haxton near

      Gisborne.
      In 1960 Charles and John, the two major owners of "Matahiia", decided to divide the property and John
      called his block "Taitai" Station. He farmed it with a manager until 1971 when his son, John William
      Stuart, took over the property. In 1967 John and Nancy retired to town and sold the orchard to outside
      interests, and a portion of the bare land was left to their elder daughter, Philippa Broad.

      Stuart b. and m, at Gisborne. Joanna, d/o Malcolm Hume Strachan and Norma Payne Brewer, b. at
      Hastings. Address: Keitha Place, Taupo.
      Stuart was educated at Hereworth School (1944-47) and Christ's College (1948-52). He played cricket
      and tennis and was in the 1st rugby XV in 1952. He also enjoyed taking part in drama and he had the
      leading role in "The Housemaster".
      After leaving school and completing his Compulsory Military Training, he started his farming career on
      an agricultural property near his parents' home. He then went on to a typical breeding property in
      Hawkes Bay for two years. In 1958 he took over the lease of "Mangarewarewa", a 400-acre block next to
      "Matahiia" Station which belonged to his great uncle and aunt, the Taplins.
      After his marriage to Joanna in 1964, they continued farming on the Coast until 1987 and raised their
      sons there. In 1971 Stuart took over his father's block, "Taitai" station and bought out all the other
      family members. He joined in many of the district activities and held senior positions in some
      organisations. Because of inherent erosion problems, Stuart sold "Taitai" to the Government for
      forestry in 1984, and in 1987 he sold "Mangarewarewa" to "Matahiia" and left the Coast to take up deer
      farming on a property known as "Sunninghill" in the Ashley Clinton district near Waipukurau.
      In 1996 Stuart and Joanna sold this property and they presently live at Kinloch on the shores of Lake
      Taupo,
      After her primary schooling at Te Puke, Joanna attended Samuel Marsden Collegiate in Wellington where
      she was a very successful student. She went on to train as a dental nurse, a career she followed until
      her marriage. She has been involved in charity work.
