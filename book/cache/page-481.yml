      International Relations at Sussex University and during the vacations travelled throughout
      Europe, always on a shoestring. When returning to Australia, she travelled from Pakistan
      through South East Asia. The war in Laos had just ended and she was one of the first people to
      travel north through Laos as far as Luang Probang. On one occasion she and Richard found
      themselves at a Red Army briefing. On her return to Australia she worked on pollution control
      at ICI Botany. She then travelled through much of Australia, lived on a commune at Nimbin, and
      later in an Aboriginal settlement at Galiwinku. For a few months she lived in the Barossa
      Valley in South Australia and then moved to Dangar Island where she met Alistair.
      In 1987 they moved to the Huon Valley region of Tasmania. It was not long before she became
      spokesperson for the Huon Protection Group. She established the Threatened Species Network in
      Tasmania then became Director of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, and in 1993 was elected to
      the House of Assembly of the Tasmanian Parliament as a member for Dennison (Hobart),
      representing the Tasmanian Greens.
      Alistair was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, England, and Lincoln College, Canterbury, New
      Zealand where he studied forestry. While in New Zealand he became interested in conservation
      matters and was a member of the Native Forest Action Council. He became a New Zealand citizen
      and has been a New Zealand non-governmental organisations representative at many overseas
      conservation conferences. In 1985 he moved to Sydney to take up a position with the World
      Wildlife Fund. In 1987 he went to Tasmania where, for several years, he was Director of the
      Wilderness Society. He set up the International Biodiversity Network, and continues to work in
