      Robin m, at Holy Trinity Church, Parakara. Anthony, s/o P H Parker (of London) and Dora Kent (of
      Suffolk). Address: PO Box 8484, Havelock North.
      Robin was educated at Woodford House and Otago Polytechnic (Physiotherapy) and Tony was educated at
      Wanganui Collegiate School and Massey University. Robin and Tony farmed Wairunga Romneys at
      Maraetotara, Hawkes Bay, with their son John until 1998 when the stud was dispersed. Tony was a
      pioneer in computer recording of sheep breeding, and Group Breeding schemes. They have a strong
      commitment to conservation and the planting of trees, and since 1985 18,000 trees have been planted on
      a block of land at Pakipaki which has since become a housing subdivision called "Enfield". Besides
      tree planting, ponds and lakes have been created to encourage wildlife. Native tree reserves and
      regeneration continues at "Wairunga" around the recently established golf course and cafe which has
      become a family interest.
      Robin and Tony have served on committees of Federated Farmers, World Congress on Sheep and Beef Cattle
      Breeding, local school, SPELD and Red Cross. In the 1960s Tony spent time in the Antarctic where he
      worked with scientists from John Hopkins University developing a more efficient method of catching
      Adelie penguins for banding. Travel remains an interest for both.
