      Pukerangi
      "Pukerangi" was originally part of the 5,225-acre "Waipari" Station which was farmed as a partnership
      between Alwyn and Greville Warren and their children until 1966. In the division of family interests,
      Alwyn's family took 3,200 acres which continued to be known as "Waipari" whilst Peter and his brother
      Roger (who was living in Auckland at that time) were partners in "Pukerangi". Eldest brother Geoffrey
      took over "Penlee" Station at the same time. Peter and Mary Warren went to live on "Pukerangi" in 1959
      when a 12 mile drive was put in and a cottage constructed. The property was developed by extensive
      regrassing and fencing. Peter purchased his brother, Roger's interest in 1979 and sold the property in
      1990.
