      b 19.04.1921
      Allen b, and m, at Napier.
      After leaving school Allen worked for Williams & Kettle for a couple of years then went to England to study
      at the College of Aeronautical Engineering (1934-38). He qualified with an Honours Diploma and was also
      awarded the Olley Challenge Trophy in his last year. He went first to North Eastern Airways and later
      British Airways working as an aircraft engineer. With the start of WW2, British Airways was merged with
      Imperial Airways to form the British Overseas Airways Corporation. About a year after the war started Allen
      was 'manpowered' to an aero engine repair depot being established at Burtonwood just out of Manchester and
      was appointed chief engine inspector. In 1942 he joined the Fleet Air Arm with the rank of Lieutenant and
      his time in the Service was divided between HMS Kestrel and the Directorate of Aircraft Maintenance and
      Repair in Admiralty. Returning to New Zealand after the war, Allen joined the staff of Tasman Empire
      Airways (which later became Air New Zealand) working first as engine inspector then chief inspector and
      finally as chief maintenance engineer. In 1961 he left the airline and joined Brown and Dureau, an
      importing and agency company, in the capacity of aviation manager. In 1972 he was promoted to general
      manager, the position he held when he retired in 1976. Allen is a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.
