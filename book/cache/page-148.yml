      Keith b. at Putiki, Wanganui and d. and bd, in France.
      Keith was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School and Cambridge University, England where he graduated BA.
      After two years as a theological student at Ridley Hall, Cambridge he was ordained deacon and spent a year
      as a curate at St James's, Hatcham, London. However, he felt he had no vocation to continue in the ordained
      ministry so he resigned and returned to New Zealand. For the next few years he worked as a shepherd on a
      cousin's farm on the East Coast. In 1916 he was called up and served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the Machine
      Gun Corps in France. He was killed in the Battle of Messines Ridge.

      Ulric b. and d. at Wanganui.
      Ulric was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School where he played in the First XV and First XI. In 1910 he
      went to Cambridge and later to Edinburgh University where he graduated MBChB. He served in France as a
      Captain in the Medical Corps. After the war he returned to Wanganui and practised there as a general
      practitioner until his retirement. He played cricket for Wanganui and was doctor to the Wanganui Rugby
      Club. He was a keen golfer and at one time held the record for several NZ golf courses including Belmont,
      Wanganui.
      In the early 1930's Ulric became interested in the relationship of diet and mental and spiritual health to
      physical health. He published a book called "Hints for Healthy Living" which had a wide readership. He
      became much in demand as a speaker on these subjects all over New Zealand and several private nursing homes
      were opened in different towns to treat patients according to his methods. Some boys' boarding schools
      adopted his diet and noted a great improvement in the general health of their pupils.
