      WILLIAMS, Samuel and WILLIAMS, Mary (cont...)
      "Waihina" was taken over by Ian Douglas Allen Faulkner and is now farmed by his son, Graham Eric Faulkner.
      Gerald Kemp died about 1920 and "Maraetaha" was bought by Enid Constance Murphy (nee Williams). After World War 2
      this property was divided between their sons, Selwyn Robert Murphy and Philip James Murphy. More recently Selwyn's
      block, known as "Mapiri" has gone to his daughter, Sally Vera Trafford (nee Murphy) and her husband Hugh Trafford.
      Philip's place, "Tararau' was taken over by his son, Jonathan Robert Murphy and in the late 1980s it was sold.
      Part was bought by Rodney George Faulkner, part by Sally and Hugh Trafford and a third part was sold out of the
      family.

      Te Aute Station
      Te Aute station was closely connected in its early years with the management of the Te Aute College Endowment
      lands. However, as a freehold property, it began with the purchase by Samuel Williams in 1874 of the 1,600 acre
      "Pukekura" block from William Douglas.
      In 1867 a disastrous flood had caused the Waipawa River to burst its banks, flooding the surrounding lands. Samuel

      Williams devised a scheme to dam the river back into its original course in order that these lands might be farmed.
      In order to do this he bought 3,567 acres comprising the Roto-a-tara lake and surrounding swamp from the Maori
      owners, Honi Waikato and Puketutu (the only time he ever bought land direct from the Maori), and 1,300 acres from W
      Rathbone, which bordered the Waipawa river. After the completion of the 500 yard long (20 ft high in one place)
      dam in the 1880s, both lake and swamp were able to be drained and the land farmed as "Te Aute" station. The dam
      still holds today.
      For many years (1875-1907) "Te Aute" was managed by Allen Marsh Williams. When Samuel died in 1907 it was then
      subdivided into four properties named "Drumpeel", "Penlee", "Kutere" and "Te Aute". The "Te Aute" block was
      inherited by William Temple Williams and farmed by him from 1907 to 1928. On his death in 1928 the "Te Aute"
      freehold land was cut in two with the "Pukekura" block of about 1,600 acres being inherited by his two daughters,
      Dorothy Frances Jackson (nee Williams) and Esther Margarita Avery (nee Williams). The 1,600 acre "Te Aute"
      homestead area passed to his sons, Charles Athol Williams and Samuel Roy Williams. In 1930 CA and SR Williams
      sold the property to their wives Mary Russell Williams (nee Burr) and Bessie Joyce Williams (nee Burr). The
      Roto-a-Tara Land Company bought 785 acres in 1935 and 240 acres was sold in 1947 to FA Hull. CA Williams managed
      the property until 1948 when management was taken over by his son-in-law, James Nelson Maclean. In 1977 his son,

      Malcolm James Maclean, took over management, the property finally being sold out of the family in 1989.
      "Drumpeel" was acquired by Allen Marsh Williams in 1907. It was farmed by his son, Edward Gordon Williams from
      1908 until 1946 when it was taken over by his son, David Empson Williams. It was sold out of the family in 1964.
      "Penlee" was inherited by Lucy Frances Warren (nee Williams). It was farmed for her by her son, Greville Williams
      Warren from 1925. It was subdivided in 1954 into two blocks, "Penlee" and "Kahotea" and the "Penlee" block was
      taken over by Greville's son, Geoffrey John Warren in 1961. The farm was sold out of the family in 1981.
      "Kahotea" Farm comprises 720 acres of which 564 acres was subdivided from "Penlee" station for Mary Williams McBain
      (nee Warren) and was initially managed by Geoffrey John Warren. In subsequent years 80 acres was acquired from
      "Drumpeel" station and 76 acres from "Kutere" station. The farm contains 300 acres of the fertile arable land
      created when Archdeacon Samuel Williams drained Lake Roto-a-tara about 1885. The farm is named after Kahotea Pa
      which is on the property and overlooks what used to be Lake Roto-a-tara. "Kahotea" has been farmed by Hugh McBain
      since 1974 and is now the only remaining part of Te Aute still being farmed by a member of the Williams Family.
      "Kutere", 200 acres, was inherited in 1907 by Canon Arthur Frederick Williams and farmed by his son, Brian Leslie
      Williams until his death in 1979. It was taken over by his son-in-law, Royston Hereaitirangi Seymour. Part was
      sold to "Kahotea" in 1980 and the remainder was sold out of the family in 1986.

      St Lawrence
      When Edward Curling took up 16,500 acres lying east of Otane in 1852, the property was known as "Te Kopanga". He
      died in 1868 leaving the station to his brother, Robert Curling, a solicitor in London. By 1885 Robert's son,
      Sumner Curling had inherited the property and changed its name to "St Lawrence". In 1901 Samuel Williams
      established the Henry and William Williams Memorial Trust with an initial gift of Â£98,000. He purchased the 13,413
      acre "St Lawrence" station as a means of providing the Trust with a continuing income. George Alexander Williams
      was appointed as manager. In 1912 the property, excepting the homestead block of 3,000 acres, was leased on
      Glasgow type leases for 21 years with right of renewal. On the death of G A Williams in 1938 his son, Richard Dow
      Williams was appointed manager. In 1964 "St Lawrence" developed from extensive to intensive farming and was
      divided into two blocks. One, named "Paihia", was managed by FB Tombleson and the other by D F Smith. By 1970
      stock numbers had increased from 3,000 to 10,300 ewes and to 570 head of cattle. In 1974 the Trust sold its
      reversionary interests in all but one of the leasehold properties and purchased a 744 acre property at Patoka.
