      at Linwood High School, Christchurch (1958-60) then lived in the United
      Kingdom and Europe for two years, teaching English for some months at Pitman's College, London. On her
      return to New Zealand she joined the staff of Wanganui Girls' College. She returned to Wanganui Girls'
      College on a part-time basis in 1975-76, when her children were of school age.
      In 1986 Janet retrained as a SPELD teacher so that she could help children with specific learning
      disabilities on a one-to-one basis, and on many occasions she has been a reader/writer for candidates
      needing such assistance during examinations. Her other interests include such handcrafts as basketry,
      rugmaking and needlepoint and embroidery, and she has recently tried her hand at producing books
      suitable for young grandchildren. She and Vincent share an interest in reading, cryptic crosswords and
      travel and they are both members of the Historic Places Trust. Over recent years they have travelled
      extensively in Australia and the UK with shorter visits to North America, Asia and Continental Europe.
      They have a collection of prints, posters and books acquired on these travels.
      For many years Janet was directly involved with life at Wanganui Collegiate School as a Housemaster's
      wife. In fact her connection with the school covers over half a century (1935-90), first as the
      daughter of a Housemaster and Second Master and then as the wife of a Housemaster and Second Master,
      and also as a parent of a pupil. For 27 of these years she lived in school houses: Selwyn (1935-46),

      Collegiate School, Hamilton then from 1962 to 1990 at Wanganui Collegiate School. There he was at
      various times, Head of Maths, Housemaster of Marris (1964-78), CO of the School Cadet Corps (attaining
      the rank of Major and being awarded the CFM), a rugby referee, in charge of outdoor education, and
      Second Master (1988-90). He was awarded an Honours Tie by Wanganui Collegiate School in 1990. His
      interests include building and computing, tramping and camping, and clocks and cats. His garden
      produces a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables to feed the family and friends all year round.
