      Endymion. A vigorous action took place
      with the loss of eleven British and ninety
      American lives. The President was
      dismasted and holed and would have sunk
      but for continuous use of the pumps. A
      prize crew, including Henry, was put
      aboard and, despite atrocious weather
      conditions and a threatened insurrection
      by the prisoners, the President was sailed
      to Bermuda. Jury masts were fitted and
      the unseaworthy vessel was navigated
      across the Atlantic through severe storms
      to Spithead where she arrived on 28 March
      1815. The good news was that Henry
      learnt of his promotion to Lieutenant; the
      bad news, which depressed him, was that
      the â€˜glorious action' of the Endymion and
      the associated loss of life had been
      unnecessary because it had been fought
      three weeks after the signing of the Treaty
      of Utrecht and its ratification by the United
      States on 17 February of that year.
