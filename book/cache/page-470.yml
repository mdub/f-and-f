      William was educated at a small private school then at Southwell Grammar School. He
      completed an apprenticeship with Mr Southwell, a surgeon, then attended Magdalen Hall,
      Oxford for two years. In 1824 he received a BA in Classics and was ordained a deacon then

      a priest by the Bishop of London. Following their marriage, William and Jane sailed for
      New Zealand on 14 August 1825 aboard the "Sir George Osborne" and, after staying a short time in Sydney, arrived at
      Paihia on 26 March 1826.

      With his scholarship and natural gift for languages, William quickly learnt Maori and took a leading part in
      translating the Bible and Prayer Book. He also taught at the mission school, acted as the doctor and assisted with
      the general maintenance of the buildings and facilities. In 1830 he built himself a two-storeyed stone house (which
      was destroyed by fire in 1856). In 1834 William made his first visit to Waiapu, travelling by sea, and conducting
      services there for large crowds of natives. This was followed by several more journeys. He sailed with William
      Fairburn and Rev J Wilson to assist them to set up the Puriri station, then led an expedition into the Waikato to
      prepare a site for a station at Mangapouri. He continued on to the Thames Valley and through to Tauranga.
      In 1835 William and Jane moved to Waimate where William supervised the missionary school, completed work on his

      Maori dictionary and continued with the translation of the New Testament. He made another visit to Poverty Bay in
      1838, travelling overland from the East Cape to Turanga. Then, at the end of 1839, he and Jane and family moved to
      Turanga to establish a permanent mission there. He was appointed Archdeacon of East Cape in 1842 and in 1859 he was
      consecrated Bishop of Waiapu.
      At the end of 1850 William left for England with Jane and two of their children. He presented a report to the
      parent Committee of the Church Missionary Society, and made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade them to reinstate
      his brother, Henry. They arrived back in Paihia in October 1852 and returned to Turanga eight months later.
      In 1857 the mission was moved to Waerenga-a-hika where there was land available for a mission farm and the
      establishment of training schools. During the early 1860's the Hauhau movement gained momentum, and their leaders
      declared their intention to kill William, whose influence was frustrating their aims. Following the murder of
      Volkner at Opotiki in March 1865, William and his family left in April for Napier and Auckland. In 1867 William and
      his family moved to Hawke's Bay and Napier became the new headquarters of his diocese. During this period he worked
      closely with his son-in-law and nephew, Samuel Williams, in the establishment of Te Aute College and Hukarere Maori
      Girls' School.
      Jane met William when she was engaged as a pupil teacher at the school in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, run by
      Williams's mother, Mary. Although never physically strong, she provided a constant support and assistance to
      William in all aspects of his work. She taught Maori girls and women the arts of household management and developed
      a close bond of friendship with many of their parishioners. During William's many long absences Jane supervised the
      day-to-day running of the mission. Her obituary stated: 'The treasure William Williams brought to these shores was
      that bright, intelligent, courageous and cheerful soul'.
