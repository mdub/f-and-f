      John b. at Twyford. Rosamond, d/o Francis Joseph Rolleston of Timaru.
      John was educated at Christ's College, Christchurch, and Sandhurst Military College. On completion of his
      training he was gazetted a Second-Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. He served for a time in China then was
      seconded to the Iraq Irregular Levies. After serving in the British Army for about five years he retired in
      1929 and returned to New Zealand. He took up farming in Hawkes Bay buying "Gola" which had originally
      formed part of the "Tunanui" station first taken up by his grandfather, Captain A H Russell. He retained
      his interest in the Armed Forces and commanded a troop of the Wellington East Coast Mounted Rifles. At the
      outbreak of WW2 he volunteered and was posted to the Second Division Cavalry as a Major. After serving in
      the campaigns in Greece, Crete and Libya he was killed in action in the Western Desert while commanding the
      22nd Wellington Battalion of which he had been made Lieutenant-Colonel.
