      Ruangarehu .
      Comprising 1,721 ha of East Coast hill country, "Ruangarehu" is situated 20 km inland from Te Puia Springs and
      was originally part of the "Waipiro" block. It has been farmed by three generations of the family since it was
      surveyed as a separate property in 1920. "Ruangarehu" was acquired by Archdeacon Herbert William Williams in
      1920 and leased to his two eldest sons, Denys William Wanklyn Williams and Quentin Williams who ran it as a
      partnership. In 1925 a private company, Ruangarehu Company Ltd, was formed to farm the property. The original
      shareholders were the seven children of H W Williams and the property was managed for the company by Denys
      Williams. At the same time the Ruangarehu Company bought "Mangatai", a 506 ha hill country property near
      Whatatutu. This was managed by Quentin Williams. "Mangatai" was the homestead block of a large property known
      as "Mangataikopua" owned by Bishop William Leonard Williams. The property having been cut up during WW1,
      "Mangatai" was sold to William Martyn Williams and his family in 1975 and farmed as a partnership. Martyn's
      death in 1984 led to the family selling the property in 1989.
      In 1952 Quentin sold his shares in Ruangarehu Co Ltd to his 16 nieces and nephews. Upon his retirement in
      1955, Denys passed on the management of the farm to his second son, Adrian Herbert Williams. During the
      following years the children of Denys bought the Ruangarehu Company shares from the other family members. A
      partnership comprising Adrian and his two sisters, Christine Louise (Kirsty) Burbury (nee Williams) and

      Margaret Anne (Peggy) Krogh (nee Williams) bought the farm from the Company in 1975. The Company retained the
      ownership of the stock until selling to the partnership in 1990, when the Company was wound up. In the same
      year another farm was purchased. This was "Highland" station, a 898 ha hill country farm, originally part of
      "Tahora" station near Wharekopai in the Matawai district.
      Adrian retired in 1991 leaving his eldest son, Mark Busby Williams, to manage "Ruangarehu" with his other son,
      Guy Leonard Williams managing "Highland", station. The partners were then Adrian, his wife, Anne, and his two
      sons, Mark and Guy.
      Following the sale of "Thungia" station (the neighbouring property) to forestry, and the closure of the local
      school, it was decided to sell "Ruangarehu" station. An agreement was reached in July 1996 to sell to Ernslow
      One Ltd, a Malaysian forestry company, and the new owners of "Ihungia" station. As part of the agreement, Mark
      is to graze the property until May 1999 when it will be planted in Radiata pine. So, about one hundred years
      after it was cleared of forest and scrub for pastoral farming, the land will once again be covered in trees.
      With the completion of the sale, the partnership between Adrian and Anne and their two sons, Mark and Guy, was
      wound up in February 1997. Guy and his wife Rebecca took over the ownership of "Highland" station while Mark
      and his wife Angela will farm "Ruangarehu" until it is planted.
