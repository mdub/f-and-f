      Alister b. at Masterton, m. at Blenheim and d. at Masterton.
      Alister was educated at Wellesley College and Wanganui Collegiate School. At Wanganui he was athletic
      champion, captain of the ist rugby XV and a member of the rowing VIII. On leaving Wanganui he went to Jesus
      College, Cambridge, where he again excelled at rugby and rowing.
      After their marriage Alister and Nancy lived and farmed at "Te Parae" and established the horse stud. With
      the outbreak of war, Alister spent time at Waiouru and eventually served overseas in the Pacific. On his
      return he and Nancy developed the horse stud by importing such successful horses as Sabaean, Agricola and
      Oncidium, the latter two being Australasian champions. Nancy was a driving force in the operation. Later,
      with the help of many of the notable breeders of the day, Alister established the New Zealand Thoroughbred
      Breeders Association. With over 3,000 members, this is now the largest organisation of its kind in the
      world.
      On their retirement in 1968, Alister and Nancy went to live at "Little Avondale", named after Nancy's
      former home at Marlborough. Alister was elected to the Masterton County Council, and died soon after the
      start of his second term.
