      Oakbourne
      In 1852 John Davis Canning purchased "Oakbourne", a property of 2,000 acres at Porangahau. He later
      increased this to 8,000 acres freehold and 32,000 acres of Maori lease. Following his death in 1883 the
      property was leased to John White from 1885 until 1905. In 1906 Davis Canning returned to "Oakbourne",
      after rebuilding the homestead which had been destroyed by fire the previous year. He introduced Romney
      and Lincoln crossbred sheep and put 1,500 ewes to Southdown rams for fat lambs, a further 5,000 ewes being
      run with pure Romneys. He had a herd of 300 Shorthorn cows and obtained bulls from Samuel Williams' stud
      at "Te Aute". He also bred Clydesdale draught horses and had a Shetland pony stud. He planted an orchard
      of 600 fruit trees and exported several hundred cases of fruit each season. He increased the wool clip
      from 150 bales in 1904 to 240 bales in 1912 and in the same year he bought out the share of his brother,
      Charles. After his death the station was reduced to 4,700 acres, the Maori leases having expired earlier.
      "Oakbourne" was run by managers until 1924 when Davis (Peter) Canning took over and ran the property for
      the trustees (K S Williams and later, AB Williams) until it was split up in 1939. Peter started his own
      Romney stud in 1932 based on six ewes and a ram given to him by AB Williams on the proviso that, if he
      ever had an outstanding ram, he would give it to AB W. In 1956 he bred a ram that was champion at Hawkes
      Bay and Palmerston North shows. He offered it to AB W and was relieved when it was not accepted. Peter
      sold the Clydesdale stud in 1935 and purchased a Caterpillar 22 tractor that is still going today. In 1939
      "Oakbourne" was divided between the four brothers, John Davis (Jack) Canning, Davis (Peter) Canning,
      Walmsley Canning and Robert Alexander Canning.
      During World War 2 Peter Canning again managed "Oakbourne" while his brothers served in the Armed Forces.
      After Jack Canning's death, his farm was managed for his daughters, Dianna Marion Poore (nee Canning) and
      Elizabeth Barrett Muspratt (nee Canning). It is now owned and farmed by James Canning Muspratt, who has
      introduced deer to his enterprise.
      Walmsley and Mary Canning retired at Kerikeri and had a manager on their farm. Robert and Fan Canning are
      retired and living on "Oakbourne" and their farm is managed by their son, Davis Charles Canning.
