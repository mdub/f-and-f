      defending New Plymouth, he rode 270 miles to Wellington in just 55 hours to summon
      help for the hard-pressed New Plymouth garrison (ref The Taranaki Herald, 14 Dec 1957). He also served with
      distinction in the battle of Mahoetahi in Nov 1860).
      Frank was always known to the Ngati Porou as Waikahua (for the story of how he came by this name see his
      parents' entry). After attending school at Christ's College he joined the staff of Williams and Kettle, working
      in their office at Port Ahuriri. Seeing no future in doing something that he did not enjoy, he left after nine
      years and went up the coast to work at "Waipiro" station, then managed by A H Wallis. In 1894 he formed a
      partnership with Raymond Kemp and Reginald Gardiner which purchased "Waipare" Station, Anaura Bay, East Coast.
      A keen student of Ngati Porou folklore, Frank assembled a notable collection of Maori artefacts most of which
      is now in the Napier Museum. He was widely respected by the Maori people of the East Coast and, being fluent in
      the Maori language, he was better able to understand their attitude to problems. Frank served on the Waiapu
      County Council for a period during the 1920s.

      Waipare Station
      A block of 10,000 acres known as "Waipare" was sold by the Maoris to Colonel Porter, probably through his Maori
      wife. He later sold it to James Nelson Williams and in 1894 is was purchased from him by a partnership
      comprising Francis James Volkner Williams, Raymond Kemp and Reginald Gardiner, Frank bought out his two
      partners sometime before 1903. The original block comprised 5,000 acres of freehold which stretched from the
