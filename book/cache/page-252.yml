      Address: PO Box 5095, Mordialloc 3195, Vic, Australia.
      Caroline is variously and concurrently a conceptual artist, a post modernist, a history painter, a
      portraitist and an installation artist. Her work addresses the issues of identity, both the personal
      and psychological, and the political, especially via the post colonial, racial and feminist discourse.
      It questions the nature of power and authority and the politics of aesthetics with an emphasis of the
      'crisis' in contemporary art.
      Caroline was educated at the Convents of the Sacred Heart in Wellington, Woldingham (UK), and Trinita
      del Monte (Rome). She then studied at the Elam School of Art, University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
      She has lived in Europe, the Middle East and Australasia and has travelled extensively in the Americas,
      Asia, Africa and Europe. In 1981 she settled in Melbourne, Australia. Her honorary positions include:
      founding Trustee of the Chiswick Audio-Visual Centre, Chiswick, London (1976), Board Member of the
      Islington Primary School, London (1980), and Industrial Advisor to Western College of TAFE, Melbourne
      (1993).
      Caroline has exhibited in over thirty solo exhibitions and over fifty group exhibitions in museums,
      public and commercial galleries in Australasia, Asia and Europe. She has represented Australia in
      international events including the 1988 Australian Bicentennial Biennale, the 1990-91 Art From
