      LUDBROOK, William Williams and McELLIGOT, Rosamund Jean (cont...)
      Ludbrook (1/3 share). Hana bought William's share in about 1907 when he left to join his brother, Reginald, on
      the Maori lease, "Wairongomai" at Ruatoria. Messrs King, McIntyre and Broad managed "Pouerua" for Hana until
      about 1918. When Ronald Henry Ludbrook returned from the war, he managed "Pouerua" together with the adjoining
      farm, "Ngaphitu" (1,000 acres), which he inherited from his older brother, Hereward Reginald Ludbrook, who died
      in the war. When brother, Geoffrey Valentine Ludbrook, married in 1927, Ronald moved to "Ngaphitu" and
      Geoffrey managed "Pouerua" for his mother until 1950, when it was sold to Geoffrey and his son, Peter Henry
      Whibley Ludbrook. They kept 1,573 acres and 960 acres were sold to three neighbouring farmers. "Pouerua" was
      farmed by a family company until 1989 when the farm was sold to John F White.
