      b 24.11.1931
      Moss b. at Gisborne and m, at Waipawa. Diana, d/o Duncan Holden and Helen White, b. at Napier. (Duncan
      and Helen Holden together with Dick Pilmer were founders of the New Zealand Horse Society. Helen
      painted portraits of horses).
      Moss was a sheep and cattle farmer at "Kaiaua" station, Tolaga Bay. He was a member of the Tolaga Bay
      School Committee (1968-82), the Tolaga Bay Vestry (1962-87) and a Synodsman (1974-84). Moss and Diana
      retired to Tauranga in 1987.
      Diana was educated at Queenswood School and Woodford House, won the sewing cup in 1948, and held two
      hurdles records. Her home life was dominated by horses, ponies and dogs - the family all went hunting
      and showring riding. On leaving school, she trained as a Karitane nurse in Dunedin, achieving honours
      in her final examination. In 1952 she went to England to meet her father's family and stayed for 212
      years, working, travelling and enjoying new experiences. Returning to New Zealand in 1954, she met and
      married Moss and settled on the farm at Tolaga Bay. Among her many activities, Diana was involved in
      Plunket, Young Wives Group and the tennis and golf clubs.
      Refer to "The Allens" published by Evagean Publishing in 1997 for information on Diana's family.

      Kaiaua
      Purchased by JB Morris in 1904, "Kaiaua" was covered in heavy bush which was felled and grassed by
      1913. Until the first wheeled vehicle roads were formed between 1910 and 1920, access was by sea or by
      way of a bridle track along the beaches and over headlands. JB Morris farmed the property until his
      retirement in 1945 when management was taken over by his daughter and son-in-law, Joyce and Harold
      Maude. John Morris (Moss) Williams managed the property from 1954 and purchased it in 1965. It was
      sold in 1987.
