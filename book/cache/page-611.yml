      WILLIAMS, Gertrude Mary Beetham and RUSSELL, Andrew Hamilton (cont...)
      of Occupation on the Rhine. He was made a KCB in 1917. After the war he played a major part in setting up the
      British Empire Servicemen's League and the New Zealand Returned Services' Association, serving as Dominion
      President for two years. He continued to farm at "Tuna Nui" for the rest of his life but retained many other
      involvements and interests, both public and private. These included the Hawkes Bay Farmers Co-op Association,
      Barraud and Abraham and the Hawkes Bay Agricultural and Pastoral Society. In 1940 he emerged from retirement
      to take up an appointment as Inspector-General of the Forces in New Zealand. He was also responsible for the
      purchase of "Mount View" station at Mangamahu, which is still owned by descendants.

      Tuna Nui
      Located some 25 miles west of Hastings, "Tuna Nui" comprised 31,000 acres of land which was leased in 1862 and
      later freeholded by brothers William Russell Russell and Andrew Hamilton Russell. The Maori owners, including
      Paora Kaiwhata and Renata Kawepo later attempted to have the purchase set aside, but in this they were
      unsuccessful. Part of the property is now known as Sherenden.
