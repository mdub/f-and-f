      Both George and Wright Coldham
      were active members of the High
      Pavement Chapel but Thomas Williams
      never became a Unitarian. It is thought
      that he was a member of the Rev George
      Walker's Literary Circle and attended the
      Chapel Gate Chapel. In order to obtain a
      seat on the Corporation of Nottingham it
      was almost essential to attend one of the
      three leading chapels - the High Pavement
      Unitarian, the George Street Baptist or the
      Castle Gate Independent.
