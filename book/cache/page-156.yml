      Margaret Boat Club in their first boat. He was ordained in 1884 and spent his life
      working amongst the Maori. He came to Te Aute straight from his Curacy in England and worked with his uncle,
      Archdeacon Samuel Williams, until 1907. He became the Archdeacon's successor in charge of all Maori Mission
      work in the Diocese of Waiapu. He spoke Maori from infancy.
      Leslie was the daughter of Leslie Thompson, one of three brothers who came out to South Canterbury in 1854 with
      their maiden aunt, Jeanie Collier, who took up runs 35 and 36 comprising 57,000 acres between the Hook and
      Otaio Rivers and the Hunter Mills near Timaru. She farmed successfully until her death in 1861 when the
      property passed to her nephews. Leslie was a trained nurse midwife and used her skills over a wide area around
      Pukehou, travelling to patients by horse and buggy. She managed to do this and raise her family largely on her
      own as Arthur was often away from home for long periods of time. After Arthur's death, when she was 73, her
      old home at Te Aute burnt down and she moved to Havelock North where she successfully re-established her life
      around her.

      Joyce was born at Te Aute and was an art student in Christchurch when she met Ernest, who had recently been
      appointed Headmaster of Christ's College. A Clerk in Holy Orders, Ernest had been educated at Clifton
      College and Balliol College, Oxford and had been a Senior Chaplain to the Forces, winning a DSO on the
      Somme and the MC at Passchendale, and the Italian Croce Merito di Guerra on the Piave in Italy.
      Appointed Headmaster of Christ's College in 1921, he fell out with the Board of Governors because he
      complained that the boys were being trained to be 'little gladiators' instead of learning Latin. Banished
      to Waihi Preparatory School, he resigned and returned to England. After a term as Chaplain to Shrewsbury
      College, he was appointed in 1933 Headmaster of Ardingly College, Sussex. Although the school had been in
      debt for ten years when he took over, he left it with twice the enrolment and a ten year waiting list.
      Despite its location between London and the South Coast, he never evacuated, and Ardingly remained, during
      WW2, the English boarding school closest to the German lines. Retiring in 1946, he became Rector of
      Henley-on-Thames and started their annual Regatta Service. Prebend of Highfield and Canon of Chichester
      Cathedral, he was Rector of Glyndebourne, Firle and Beddingham at the time of his death.
      Joyce continued to live at Glyndebourne for some years before returning to Ardingly. Later she moved to
      the Norwich Cathedral Close, Norfolk where she was active in the painting community. A fine water colour
      artist, she exhibited at the Royal Water Colour Society and earned her first penny teaching art when she
      was 80 years old.
