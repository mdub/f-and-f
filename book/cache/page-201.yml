      Thomas b. in England.
      After being commissioned in the Lancashire Fusiliers in Flanders, he volunteered to fly and served in
      34 Squadron RFC during WW1. He survived multiple wounds from machinegun-fire and a crash landing
      towards the end of the war. He was a founding director of Consolidated Press in Sydney with FH
      Packer, was on the Mascot Airport Committee when Kingsford Smith made his famous inaugural flight to
      New Zealand in the "Southern Cross", an was Principal of T H Wynne-Lewis and Sons, Chartered
      Accountants, based at 14 Martin Place. He was a director of a number of Australian companies, and was
      the longest serving member of the Royal Sydney Golf Club when he died at age 94.
      Nunie served for a time on the Waitangi Trust Board and had a life-long interest in the involvement of
      the Williams and Busby families in the early history of New Zealand. She came from an era when much of
      this early history was remembered and had been passed on to her by her mother and other older members
      of the family. She became an authority on matters relating to the family. Until recently Nunie and Toc
      lived in the Bay of Islands on the site of the original Henry Williams house on the Paihia beachfront.
      The original iron fireplace from Henry's house was used by Nunie as a flower pot stand (it is now used
      for the same purpose in the Wellington garden of her son, John).
