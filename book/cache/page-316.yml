      prosperous. John's father, Henry (1754-1808) had been Lord Mayor of Dublin.
      Thomas arrived in New Zealand in 1844 and became a student at St John's College, Auckland. Later he was a master at
      the Upper English Collegiate School under Mr Cotton. He was artistic, hard-working, clever and rather 'moody'. In
      1847 he was ordained Deacon. He illustrated Mr Cotton's diary, and hotly defended Henry Williams against a
      newspaper attack in 1848 concerning the Land Issue. Due to overwork he fell very ill and went to the Williams' home
      in Paihia to recover.
      In 1849 Thomas was made Inspector of Schools in the Wellington district. He went to live in Wellington to assist Mr
      Cole and in May he married Sarah at the Church of St James in the Hutt. A few days after the wedding he and Sarah
      attended a levee in Wellington to celebrate Queen Victoria's birthday.
      In 1853 Thomas was ordained a Priest by Bishop Hadfield in the same ceremony as Samuel Williams. On 23 Feb 1855,
      while he was visiting Sir David Munro in the Hutt Valley, the Great Earthquake occurred and he assisted the Munros
      to escape from their home as the chimney fell down. Due to continued ill health, Thomas had to leave the Hutt
      Valley on 20 Oct 1858 and he went to live in Paihia. A testimonial letter from his parishioners was published in
      the newspaper and he received a gift of 130 sovereigns. Shortly after Sarah's death in 1866, Thomas returned to
      England,
      He served as Curate in Tankersley and Chapeltown in Yorkshire (1869-79) and as Vicar at St John's, Hoylandswaine,
      Yorkshire (1879-85). At some time he married Sarah Marriott from the Barnsley district of Yorkshire. In 1885 Thomas
      retired due to ill health and died a year later.
      Thomas wrote two books, "Maori Legends and Records" and "Reflections of Life and Character at Home and Abroad". He
      was also a fine artist and his works can be seen at several locations in New Zealand, especially at the Alexander
      Turnbull Library in Wellington (E137) which has a collection of his sketches around the Purewa area in 1845. Some
      of his work is also in the British Museum.
