      HARVEY WILLIAMS, Samuel Frederick and COOK, Dorothy Helen (cont...)
      two years active service in Waziristan on the North West Frontier. Following this he transferred to the
      107th Pioneers and spent two years in Iraq. On his return to India the five Pioneer regiments were combined
      into the Bombay Pioneers and he served with them until they were disbanded in 1932, in a further
      reorganisation of the Indian Army. He was then posted to the 7th Gurkhas and remained with them until his
      retirement in 1947. With the Gurkhas he saw service in Chaman on the Afghanistan border; at Shillong where
      the regiment was commanded by Bill Slim (later Field Marshall Lord Slim who remained a personal friend); at
      Staff College in Calcutta and, eventually, as 2nd in command of the 3/7th Gurkhas in the 14th Army in
      Burma, where he was wounded. After the war his regiment was heavily involved with the Hindu/Muslim riots at
      the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 and, shortly after this, he retired with the rank of Lt-Col, in
      command of the Regimental Centre at Palampur.
      On his retirement back in England, Sam initially took on voluntary work such as Treasurer of the local
      division of the Red Cross and on a committee for helping the blind. The Army had just started a scheme to
      provide employment for retired officers as temporary civil servants in administrative situations to enable
      younger officers to be released for more military duties and Sam became an R03 for nearly ten years.
      Following this, he obtained a job as a school bursar until he finally retired in 1968 to pursue his
      interests as a keen gardener, with a particular interest in herbs.
      He lived for a while at Farnham in Surrey, then at Crondall where he was treasurer of the local church and
      chairman of the Parish Council for several years and, finally, at Ashley Green near Chesham.

      Just before the Second World War, Nevil's mother had gone to India to spend a short period with his
      father so, instead of her returning to the UK, Nevil and his sister were evacuated to India by sea in
      1940. He attended Sheikh Bagh Preparatory School in Kashmir until 1944, when he returned to England,
      with his mother and sister, to complete his education at Marlborough College. He then trained as an
      electrical engineer but also had to do two years National Service, which he served with the Royal
      Engineers in the Canal Zone, Egypt. He played hockey for the Army in Egypt. On leaving the Army he
      first worked for a firm of Consulting Engineers in London but, after a few years, moved to become a
      Management Consultant with the P-E Consulting Group. One assignment took him to West Africa for a year,
      working with the newly independent Government of Sierra Leone. He left P-E in 1972 and since then has
      worked in his own business. Nevil has been an enthusiastic researcher of the Williams family during the
      periods they lived at Gosport, Nottingham and Southwell.
