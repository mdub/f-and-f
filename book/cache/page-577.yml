      HARVEY WILLIAMS, Simon Philip and SAMUEL, Angela Mary (cont...)
      India and the Himalayas helped to enliven an abiding passion for travel. His other interests
      include art, architecture, history, photography, music, films and theatre.
      Angela was educated at Aldershot County High School for Girls and The University of Sheffield,
      where she graduated with an Honours degree in Ancient History. Before starting a family, Angela
      lived in London for ten years and worked in public relations in the professional theatre. She was
      also an active member of a number of amateur dramatics groups, so theatre formed a major part of
      her life. To enable her to bring up their two children, Angela took a career break, and also
      helped Simon with the financial administration of their business partnership. Recently she has
      started a teacher training course with The Open University, with the intention of becoming a
      secondary school history teacher. Angela's interests include walking, swimming, reading, travel,
      history and heritage. She lived in France for a year and speaks French well.
