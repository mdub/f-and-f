      Arnold b. at Frimley, Hastings and m. at Waipiro Bay. Emma nee Brown was previously married to Arthur Merritt
      Beale. There were eight Beale children, three of whom were adopted by Arnold.

      Bay, Banks's Peninsula and Christ's College (school prefect, athletics champion and NZ 440 yds title holder,
      1st cricket XI, 1st rugby XV). He attended Cambridge University (Jesus College ist rugby XV in 1890-91). He
      also played rugby for the Blackeath Club while in England. He worked with the London Woolbrokers for two years,
      then was called home by his father to supervise his farming operations in the Waiapu County, making his
      headquarters at Waipiro Bay. He eventually settled at "Puketiti" Station, Te Puia Springs. Arnold served on the
      Waiapu County Council (1895 -1927), the Tokomaru Bay Harbour Board (1921 - 1924) and the Waiapu Hospital Board

      Many fine trees around his homestead bear testimony to his interest in conservation. After WW2 he set up a
      Trust as a memorial to his two sons who were killed in the war, and this has helped many local organisations.
      He also helped to establish sports, particularly rugby, in the Waiapu district.
      Arnold was a successful racehorse breeder and owner, winning many of the major races in New Zealand and
      Australia. Amongst his outstanding horses were Rapine, Star Stranger and Bandmaster.
