      Gavin b. at Wanganui and m, at St Barnabas Church, Kensington, London. Catherine, d/o Kenneth
      Macdonald and Catherine Mary Clements, b, at Hamilton. Address: "Cullerlie", RD 1, Gisborne.
      Gavin discovered music while studying physics at Otago University, met Catherine while singing in
      the Auckland Dorian Singers and teaching at Lynfield College (1970-72), and found green politics
      while singing with various teachers and small opera groups around London. This brought Gavin and
      Catherine back to the Gisborne homestead in 1976, as a base for low-impact living. Gavin works as a
      singer, singing teacher, woodturner, grower of trees, political activist, stage director, and
      conductor of the Gisborne Choral Society (since 1979). Catherine directs the music at St Andrew's
      Church and accepts solo singing engagements in opera and oratorio nationally.
