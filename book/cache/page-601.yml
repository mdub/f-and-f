      WILLIAMS, James Nelson and BEETHAM, Mary-Margaret (cont...)
      Edenham
      In 1879 James Nelson Williams bought what he considered his best farm land. Lying south of Elsthorpe, it comprised
      some 8,000 acres of the block, part of the Hapuku purchase, which had originally been taken up in 1851 by Alfred
      Chapman and Captain Rhodes. With further purchases JNWilliams' acreage eventually totalled 16,500. Some flat
      areas were subject to flooding, and in 1889 there were severe sheep losses. However, in 1900 some 27,000 sheep
      were being grazed. "Edenham" was managed in its early years by A H Wallis, and for a period before 1901, by
      Heathcote Beatham Williams. Over the next few years JN Williams subdivided the property amongst members of his
      family. The homestead block went to Winifred Beetham Nelson (nee Williams) who sold it in 1911. Another
      subdivision was named "Waipuna" and went to Edric Beetham Williams. Mangakuri
      The 21,000 acre 'Hapuku" block situated about 10 miles south-east of Elsthorpe was taken up about 1853 by Frederick
      Hargrave and Peter Couper. In 1859 the lease was taken over by Lt-Col Andrew Hamilton Russell. In 1862 Russell
      purchased 2,000 acres of the leasehold and by 1866 the remainder of the property had been made freehold, In 1876 A
      H Russell sold 21,000 acres freehold to James Nelson Williams for Â£50,750. Ownership subsequently passed to Samuel
      Williams of Te Aute. He had a church built on "Mangakuri" and services were taken by George Coldham Williams who
      managed the station. On the death of Samuel Williams in 1907 the property was subdivided. "Clareinch" went to his
      nephew, Allen Douglas Williams and the "Waipari" block to his daughter, Lucy Frances Warren (nee Williams).
      "Rangitapu" went to George Coldham Williams and the "Mangakuri" homestead block of about 5,400 acres went to
      William Temple Williams.
      "Rangitapu" was later divided amongst his family by GC Williams. It was run as an estate until after the death of
      his wife, Mary (Molly) Williams (nee Mollat). A part of the station was sold shortly after World War 2 and the
      remainder about 1982.

      Tuakau
      A lease on this property was taken up by James Nelson Williams in the 1880's. It was later made subject to a
      charitable trust set up as a memorial to H H Beale and A K Williams who lost their lives in World War 2.

      Waipiro
      In 1883, seeking pastoral land for the family, James Nelson Williams explored the East Coast north of Tolaga.
      After three years of negotiation some 37,000 acres, centred on Waipiro Bay, were leased from the Ngati Porou. The
      land was to prove of varying quality, cattle died from tutu poisoning, and the original Lincoln sheep did not
      thrive. Its eventual prosperity owed much to A H Wallis, the first manager, who gave able leadership to the
      development of both land and community until 1901. Arnold Beetham Williams came to "Waipiro" in 1892 and Heathcote
      Beetham Williams in 1901, from which date both brothers carried on the management.
      Access was by sea at Waipiro, which remained an important centre until the development of the inland road following

      World War 1. The lease played a vital part in the development of farming throughout the whole of the Waiapu area.
      JN Williams was able to purchase a number of properties, some mainly in bush, whose holders had found the
      conditions too difficult. These were taken up at various stages by relatives, and by his sons, A B and HB

      Williams. By 1900 JN Williams "controlled by one tenure or another, more than 100,000 acres." ("Land of the
      Sunrise", AB Williams, p19).
      In the mid 1890s JN Williams and others were suffering criticism for their aggregation of large land holdings and,
      partly to counter this, "Waipiro" was offered to the Government for closer settlement. After inspection in 1896 by
      the Land Settlement Board the Chairman, James McKerrow concluded that it was unsuitable for settlement and the
      offer was declined. Believing that Williams had made a bad bargain on the property, credit sources withdrew their
      support. However the establishment of the freezing industry in Gisborne in the late 1890s brought a change of
      fortune. In 1894 the lease of "Waipiro" was held to be deficient and a new 21-year lease was negotiated. When
      this expired in 1915 the block was returned to its Maori owners.
