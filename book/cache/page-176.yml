      August 1833 to June 1834 he managed the pharmaceutical establishment of Dr Phelan and
      William Malone at Clonmel, County Cork. He then began his studies for the medical profession; from 1836 to 1838 at
      the Cork School of Physic and Surgery; then from 1839 to 1840 at the Cork School of Anatomy, Medicine and Surgery;
      the Cork Institute and Hospital for the Care of Pregnant Women and the Treatment of Illnesses of Women and Children
      and The Cork North Infirmary. In 1841 he spent three months at the School of Medicine of the Apothecaries Hall.
      Soon afterwards he sailed for New Zealand and arrived early in 1842 on the Kiti Kiti from Sydney. He set up
      practice as a surgeon in Kororareka and immediately took steps to fulfil his ambition to join the Church Missionary
      Society. He consulted with Bishop Selwyn, Henry Williams, William Williams, Alfred Brown and the Secretary of the
      Parent Committee. At the same time he sought the hand of Marianne Williams. Jane Williams wrote to say that she and

      William "were much pleased with him... he is a very decided character and clever in his profession". Henry also
      approved of him but wrote to A N Brown to say that "The young man is rather urgent in his demands and wants to
      carry her off earlier than we approve. We think about the commencement of the year." Christopher was accepted as a
      catechist and he and Marianne moved to Waimate where Marianne, with the help of Christopher and Elizabeth Colenso,
      took over responsibility for the Infant School. In September 1844 Christopher was ordained a Deacon at the Waimate

      Mission Station in the same ceremony that Henry Williams and Alfred Brown were inducted as Archdeacons. Soon
      afterwards he and Marianne moved to Te Papa Station at Tauranga where, for the next seven years, he assisted
      Archdeacon Brown. His pastoral duties included extensive and arduous travel throughout the district to Matamata,

      Maungatautari, Rotorua, Thames and Taupo. In 1852 Christopher and his family transferred to Opotiki to take over
      the station established by John Wilson. His work there also involved him in regular visitations to pas and villages
      as far east as Raukokore and inland to Te Whaiti and Waimana. During his frequent absences, responsibility for the
      Boarding School rested with Marianne. Christopher's health continued to deteriorate and in 1856 he left Opotiki for
      Auckland to seek medical advice. The advice was that he should leave Opotiki and move with his family to Paihia.
      This was nine years before the Rev Volkner was killed at Opotiki by the Hau Haus. He continued his missionary and
      medical work until his death in 1861.
      After the death of her mother, Anna Hutton lived with the Davies for some time. She related to her grandchildren
      how Christopher had a big bell on the roof of his house which was rung if a patient needed to see the doctor whilst
      he was out on his rounds. It could be heard from a great distance but, if the doctor did not hear it himself,
      someone would pass the message on to him.

      George was educated at the school run by his mother and grandmother and at the Church
      of England Grammar School, Auckland under Dr Kinder. His early education included not

      only studying the Bible, but memorising much of it. At least one member of his family
      believed he may have regretted turning down Bishop Suter's request to seriously consider ordination. In late
      life he often used to walk several miles from his Karori home to Matthias Makara to take the Sunday evening
      service.
      In 1872 he joined the Government Service in Wellington as an interpreter. He had previously acted for some
      years in this capacity in the Bay of Islands and was licensed by the Government as an interpreter. Upon the
      promotion of Mr T E Young to the position of judge of the Native Land Court, George became a translator. When
      Sir Donald McLean was Native Minister, George frequently accompanied him on his journeys in a confidential
      capacity. He retired in 1907. He taught his sons to speak and write Maori - but not the daughters lest they
      understood some of the unedifying language heard outside the city pubs. He and Rose Alma would entertain Maori
      leaders and received gifts from them, including Maori cloaks.
      He displayed a keen interest in local affairs and was a member of the Karori School Committee for a number of
      years. As a chess player he was one of the original members of the Wellington Chess Club and was selected to
      play in inter-provincial matches.
