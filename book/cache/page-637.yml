      Bill lived in Hastings from the age of 312 and Hereworth School (1952-55), Wanganui Collegiate School

      address, a farm which they first managed and then leased from the family. In 1973 they bought the
      family out.
      Lyndon is a trained teacher and did some part-time teaching at Norsewood School during some of their
      early married years, until family commitments became a priority. Later she took a more active role in
      the farm, particularly in the planning and financial management. She also initiated a speakers' forum
      where local women could socialise.
      Bill was a member of the Norsewood School Committee for ten years, four of them as chairman. More
      recently he spent six years as the elected member for Norsewood on the Dannevirke Community Board. His
      interests have included fishing, diving, tramping and power-boat racing.
