      Terence b. at Gisborne and m. at Wairoa. Joyce, d/o Gordon Nolan and Cathy
      Brandon. Address: 170a Rutene Road, Kaiti, Gisborne.
      Terence was educated at Huntley School, Marton (1927-29), Christs College
      (1930-33) and Massey College (1936-37). He graduated with a Diploma in
      Sheepfarming and won the Norton Francis Medal in 1937. During WW2 he served as

      Wainui Beach. He was a member of the Cook County Council (1950-80) and Chairman (1971-80). He was
      awarded the QSO in 1982. Terence was appointed to the Trust Board of the Eastwoodhill Arboretum
      (1975-86) and was the supervisor from 1981, for some eight years. The time involved with Eastwoodhill
      was probably the most rewarding period of his life. It was during those years that Eastwoodhill was
      restored to a stage when new plantings could be started again.
      Since 1975 HB (Bill) Williams has been chairman of the Trust Board and this enabled many development
      projects to be completed. Eastwoodhill is recognised internationally for its collection of Northern
      Hemisphere trees, shrubs and climbers.
      Joyce was a VAD during WW2 and was later involved in the Women's Division of Federated Farmers. She
      and Terence now live in a retirement flat in Gisborne.
