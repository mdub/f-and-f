      establishment of the Wiliams Family in
      New Zealand was marked by a family
      reunion held at Paihia over the weekend
      of 16 - 19 April 1998. Some 800 family
      members gathered from throughout New
      Zealand and around the world to renew
      old acquantances and make new ones, to
      reminisce and to look forward to the
      future. The venue was the Copthorne

      visited by coach tours and cruises and the
      spiritual heritage of the family was evident

      contribution to the history of New
      Zealand.

      organise the discussion, provided
      inspiration to the younger members of the

      thought, as well as resounding calls to
      action, on issues of the day.
