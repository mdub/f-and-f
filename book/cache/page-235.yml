      A mother struggled to bring up the family. Jack trained with a merchant firm for six
      years then spent six years in Australia where he worked at sheep farming, surveying and tutoring. He then
      travelled for a Bordeaux wine merchant (he spoke French fluently) before arriving aged 31 in New Zealand, with
      a letter of introduction to Mrs Lowry of Okawa. He and Lucy were married five years later and they lived for
      the next ten years in Wellington, where Jack had established an import-export business.
      In 1906 they moved, with their three children, to Hawkes Bay for Jack to assist Lucy's father, Archdeacon
      Samuel Williams, with the administration of Te Aute College, and his farming interests. However, the Archdeacon
      died the following year.
      In 1914 the family went to England, where, for the duration of the war, Lucy worked at a canteen and social
      centre for New Zealand soldiers at Hornchurch, Essex. Although over-age, Jack, using the skills developed in
      voluntary military training in New Zealand, gained a temporary commission as Major in the Royal Field
      Artillery, and served in the Home Service; as a Battery Commander in France; and, for several months, as
      Director of the Allies' Hospital at Yvetot in France. They returned to New Zealand in 1920.
      Samples of Lucy's wood carving, and Jack's beaten copper work, resulting from training at night classes in
      Wellington, can be seen in the old Penlee House (now Langton House) at Pukehou. Lucy was a good pianist, and
      needlewoman, producing fine embroidery, smocking and church frontals.

      March 1925, he managed "Penlee" station, a family sheep and cattle property near Pukehou, before retiring
      to Havelock North in 1961.
      Norah completed her education in Sydney, being admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, and later
      attended Oxford University where she was awarded a Diploma in Education. She loved travelling and
      languages. It was while she was teaching at Woodford House, Havelock North that she became engaged to
      Greville,
      Greville was a Synod representative for 11 years, a long term Vestry member and a Lay Reader. He became a
      member of the Te Aute College Trust Board in 1951, and helped to steer the College through major
      development stages until he resigned in 1975. He was a member of the Waipawa Hospital Board for 25 years,
      15 of them as Deputy Chairman. His main responsibilities were the Waipukurau Hospital and the Pukeora
      Sanatorium. He was also a long-time member of the Henry and William Williams Trust, and a Justice of the
      Peace.
      Greville was a very experienced and talented wood and metal turner. His fully equipped turning and gear
      cutting lathe was bought new in 1936 for sixteen Pounds, being originally intended for a British ship that
      was never built.
      Between the wars keen fishermen from the Williams family used to camp together under canvas each year near
      Turangi and fish the Tongariro and surrounding rivers. Greville regularly joined the group, which often
      numbered as many as 30 men.
