      and European carpenters. Hall was a
      shipwright and carpenter, and although he
      was personally opposed to the
      construction of the ship, he continued to
      work on it. He estimated that it would
      cost £1,000 to build and cost £500 a year
      to maintain, and considered that the effort
      put into the project would be better spent
      on the principal work of the missionaries.

      Trees were selected from the forests
      at Kawakawa felled, dragged to the river,
      and transported by rafts to Paihia for pitsawing. Some use was also made of the
      timber from the wrecked Brampton.
      Kemp assisted by bringing cut timber on
      a raft from Kawakawa to Paihia and later
      in the year Kauri was collected for
      planking. The first plank was placed at
      the beginning of 1825 and by the end of
      that year Henry was able to write:

      "She is fifty feet from end to end,
      fifteen feet wide and will draw seven
      feet of water. She will be schooner
      rigged with accommodation for
      passengers and capable of bringing any
      supplies we may require in one year.
      Until the present time the missionaries
      have been frequently at their wit’s end
      for want of common necessities, and
      have very often been obliged to obtain
      flour from the shipping which ought
      not to be. The members have
      consequently placed themselves under
      the obligations to the masters of ships

      which has been very prejudicial. At
      this time we have not ten days' flour
      on the Island and when supplies have
      come from the Colony they have
      generally been bought in a most
      scandalous manner; cases broken and
      plundered to a considerable extent, and
      if it should be necessary for anyone to
      go to the Colony, he is subject to
      terrible Society and painful language.
      It was with the object of placing
      ourselves independent of the shipping
      [that] I undertook the building of the
      present vessel. In addition to the
      advantage of her going to the Colony
      she will be convenient for going along
      the coast to visit other parts of the
      island. She will be as fine a model as
      we could devise and as well-built as
      any vessel out of London. I shall have
      one seaman belonging to her. The
      remainder of the crew will consist of
      natives belonging to this settlement.
      For the present I will be required to be
      in charge of her. Mr. Fairburn, the
      carpenter here, will be chief officer.
      She may run over [to the Colony] once
      a year and be back in a month or six
      weeks”.
