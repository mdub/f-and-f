      Williams family. From the first days in New
      Zealand, Henry and Marianne, and later William and
      Jane, maintained contact with family in England with
      a continuous flow of letters back and forth. They
      also sought and received advice and support, both
      practical and financial, from sister and brother-inlaw, Lydia and Edward Garrard Marsh, as well as
      others in the family.

      The pleasure expressed by Marianne at the
      arrival of William and Jane to lend support to their
      early endeavours at Paihia, was real and heartfelt.
      The two brothers and their wives worked together
      as a team, lending support to each other throughout
      their lives. The closeness of the two families carried
      on into the next generation with two marriages
      between cousins. And when Henry was beset by
      attacks from Grey and others during the 1840s,

      William took up the battle on his behalf and travelled
      to England to plead his cause.

      Henry's woes wree caused, of course, by his
      concern for the future of his children. And they, in
      their turn, provided solace and a secure refuge for
      their parents at The Retreat at Pakaraka.

      Over the ensuing years it became customary for
      the family to look out for each other in a variety of
      ways. There was the particular example of Samuel
      in the way in which he helped others in the family to
      become established on farms on the East Coast. He
      was also instrumental in establishing the Henry and
      Williams Memorial Trust as a means of perpetuating
      his work. Of course, a major objective was the
      support of various religious and social causes, but
      the welfare of family was not forgotten. No member
      of the extended Williams family has failed to gain
      an education through lack of the money to pay for
      it. And many have gained their first job and their
      training in farming by working on the farms of other
      family members. It is interesting to note that this
      book records 198 sons of the family who have
      received their education at Wanganui Collegiate
      School.

      The land and the Church have continued to be
      significant influences in the family throughout their
      history in this country. Farming still provides for
      the largest occupational group in the family, whilst
      the tradition of service to the Church, both within
      the ministry and as laity, is very strong in all branches
      of the family. Of course, as the family has grown in
      size, it has also grown in diversity. Family members
      have served in high office in law, medicine,
