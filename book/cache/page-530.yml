      MACLEAN. Timothy Williams and DRUMMOND, Pamela Anne (cont...)
      born. There Tim and Pam worked as a team building up their small farm and aiming for excellence in
      every aspect. They raised the lambing percentage, planted thousands of trees for both amenity and
      land conservation and produced wool from their Romney flock to rival the best in the district.
      They were both keen members of a land care group.
      Tim was innovative and imaginative. As a 'lay' geologist he became very knowledgeable about the
      land formation of the Waimarama district and the farm gave him ample scope to exercise his skills
      as a 'lay' engineer. He also enjoyed mountaineering, sailing, hang-gliding and travelling. He and
      Pam spent four years travelling the world together, working as they went, she as a nurse and he as
      a builder. They climbed in the Himalayas and dived in the Red Sea, living for a time in a Bedouin
      hut on the Sinai Peninsula. After a year in London, they went to the United States, then on to
      Southern India and Australia. There they spent a year in Brisbane and hitch-hiked across the
      Nullabor Plains from Perth to Adelaide. Tim learnt to sail a catamaran, later owning one of his
      own at Waimarama.
      Tim was a skilled musician, playing the guitar and harmonica (simultaneously), and had a great
      sense of humour. He and Pam both gave strong support to the Waimarama School where Tim was
      Chairman of the Board of Trustees until his accidental death on the farm. Since then Pam has coped
      with the sale of the farm and a move to Havelock North where she and the children are building a
      new life together. She is a registered nurse and is presently working for Healthcare Hawkes Bay.
