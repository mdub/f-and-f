      | number of years. He was a farming adviser for the Department of Maori Affairs and
      did much to help the development of Maori farming in the district. He was also a member of the Ruatoria
      Racing Club. The farm was sold in the 1940's and Athel went to Warkworth for a short while before returning
      to retirement in Gisborne. Athel was a keen trout fisherman and devoted at great deal of time to the
      introduction of fingerlings into many East Coast rivers. For this work he was granted Life Membership of
      the Acclimatisation Society. His other interest was gardening.
      Prior to their marriage, Jessie was the school teacher at Ruatoria.
