      Western Europe from Trondheim in Norway to Valetta in Malta. In 1970 he joined Reuters as man in
      charge of their economic news service to all of Africa (South of the Sahara, except South Africa).
      He returned to Wellington in 1973 to become Sales Manager for A H & A W Reed, publishers. Some
      months later he had a sort of 'Damascus Road' experience which led him to return to England to
      offer for ordination. Upon acceptance he trained for 2 years at Queen's College, Birmingham. After
      serving a curacy in a Liverpool parish he was appointed as vicar of a parish in a deprived area of
      the industrial town of St Helen's where there is 40% unemployment. Despite offers of easier
      positions, Christopher and Kathy have chosen to stay in Parr Mount where the parish life has been
      greatly enlivened by their joint ministry. With teams from his parish, Christopher is in increasing
      demand to visit other parishes as far away as London on behalf of the Anglican Renewal Movement and
      the Decade of Evangelism
