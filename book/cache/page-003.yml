      FOREWORD
      This latest reprint of the Williams Family 'Stud Book’, has been occasioned by the holding of a
      family reunion to commemorate the 175th Anniversary of the arrival of Henry and Marianne Williams
      in the Bay of Islands. It is the latest in a succession of worthy publications, many of them produced by

      members of the family. In particular, though, it is an update of the book, Faith and Farming, produced
      by Evagean Publishing in 1991. In preparing this publication, we have had three main objectives: Firstly
      to record the arrivals, departures and marriages that have occurred in the intervening years and to include

      o personal biographies. In this, we have been only partially successful. Although
      printouts were sent to 1,149 families, only 446 replies were received. Our second objective was to
      present more of the history of the brothers, Henry and William, and their wives, Marianne and Jane.

      Whilst the public aspects of their careers have been dealt with in a number of scholarly works, we felt
      that this family book could be an appropriate vehicle to present a picture of their private and family lives,
      in so far as this is known. To do this, we have drawn extensively on the book, Shield of Faith by George
      Davies for information on the lives of Henry and Marianne. For William and Jane, we have chosen to
      reprint the booklet, East Coast (NZ) Historical Records which was compiled by their son, Bishop W L

      Williams and printed after his death by the Poverty Bay Herald in Gisborne. Whilst it does not deal in
      depth with their family life, it is an important historical record of a turbulent period in which the family
      were central figures. We decided to print it in full because of its relative rarity, and because of its

      ılarly to the many family (nearly one third) who still live in the Poverty Bay area.
      Our third objective was to utilise new technology that makes practical the inclusion of a much larger
      number of photographs. We are pleased to say that this part of the project has been particularly successful
      and we have been able to collect over 600 photographs, many of them historically significant.

      Besides being produced as printed and bound volumes, we have also brought out a CD-rom version
      of the publication for use on computers. Whilst it is unlikely that any further reprint would be undertaken
      before the 200th anniversary reunion, we do intend to maintain the family database with any new
      information that is sent to us, and family members are urged to provide us with changes of address and
      births, deaths and marriages. We wish, also, to continue adding to our archive of photographs. As they
      are received, we will copy them and return them to the owners. This additional data will be added to the
      master CD-rom and available to family members at any time.

      The following introduction to the lives of Henry and Marianne Williams is drawn from the Synopsis
      of Sheild of Faith by George Davies. For William and Jane Williams, we have reprinted the text of the
      address given by Frances Porter on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the death of Bishop William
      Williams
