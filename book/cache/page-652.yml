      home base in Paihia for many of the
      recently deceased or still living members
      of the family. Built in 1924 by Canon
      Percy, it occupies land that was originally
      purchased by Henry Williams on behalf
      of the Church Missionary Society on 19
      November 1827. Part of this land was sold
      in 1851 to WL Williams and R Burrows
      and in 1891 they sold 474 acres to the New
      Zealand Mission Trust Board. Canon
      Percy Williams purchased his site in
      January 1920. It was occupied at that time
      by the old house that had been home to
      Lydia and Hugh Carlton and he
      demolished this to make way for the
      construction of his house in 1924. A
      remaining outhouse of the Carleton
      dwelling was retained and used as a
      storehouse, and is still there today.

      Heritage Trust in 1993, with Mary

      stewardship of the property was assumed
