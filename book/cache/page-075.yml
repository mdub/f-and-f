      Lydia b. at Paihia, m, at Pakaraka and d. at Napier, Hugh, s/o Francis Carleton and Charlotte Margaretta
      Montgomerie, b. in England and d. at Lewisham, Surrey, England.
      Hugh was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, then studied Law at Middle Temple, London. After
      studying classical art in Italy, and travelling for three years, he arrived in Auckland in 1845. He was
      involved in various trading ventures between New Zealand and Australia and around the Pacific before entering
      politics. He was elected to the General Assembly in 1853 as representative for the Bay of Islands and served
      continuously until 1870,
      He was interested in music and higher education and was a prolific writer. He helped to found the Auckland
      Choral Society and the University of New Zealand and served as the first Vice-Chancellor of the latter
      organisation from 1871 to 1878. He was editor of the newspaper, "Southern Cross" and he wrote "A Page from the
      History of New Zealand" under the pen name of Metoikos. This was a defence of Henry Williams against the
      charges of land aggregation being levelled against him at the time. He also wrote "The Life of Henry Williams"
      in two volumes published in 1874 and 1877. This work was edited and revised by James Elliott in 1948.
