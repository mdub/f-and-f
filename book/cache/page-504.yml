      most of it and developed a very attractive garden. Mangarara is isolated and at that time bread had to be
      made at home, as well as butter. The road was only metalled in parts and access was problematical in wet
      weather. Winter stores included one ton of flour and half a ton of sugar. There were never less than two
      single men on the place and Lucy had to recruit and train a succession of girls to cook and cater.
      Electricity did not reach Mangarara till long after Lucy's lifetime. She supervised Fray's correspondence
      lessons as best she could but Fray was probably more stimulated by station life than either of his parents
      and his concentration on things academic was spasmodic at best. Lucy must have been vastly relieved when
      he went to boarding school in 1935.
      Despite isolation and restrictions on petrol availability during the long war years, Lucy made many good
      friends. She gave Olin sterling support in what was often a discouraging job at Mangarara. In 1945 she
      was diagnosed as suffering from cancer and given a terminal prognosis. Shirley, still in England at the
      time, was able to get home and gave her some support. She displayed incredible courage during the final
      months of her life and died on
      16th March 1947, two days before her 54th birthday and one day before Fray's return to New Zealand after
      an absence of five and a half years.
      Olin was born in England and arrived in New Zealand with his parents on 6th Nov 1899. The ship was named
      Wakanui. He was educated at Waitaki Boys' High School. He farmed in the Ruakituri Valley on a property
      believed to have been leased from Maori owners, which may have been called "Tauwharetoi". While there he

      married Lucy and in 1920 they moved to the Waiatai Valley near Wairoa. That venture ended sadly in the
      recession of 1926 when his mortgagee foreclosed.
      They lived somewhat uneasily with Lucy's family at Waiohika until 1930 when they moved to Mangarara which
      Olin managed for the Trustees of Charles Gray's Estate. Farming revenues were far from buoyant in the
      1930s but after a few very difficult years it became possible to carry out some vital improvements such as
      subdivision, the provision of holding paddocks and additions to the woolshed. Gradually Mangarara became
      more workable and with steady improvement in the prices of primary produce the returns from the property
      rose to a reasonable level. The outbreak of War in 1939, of course, brought its own difficulties and Olin
      struggled on through those years with a totally inadequate labour force. Tragically, with peace in sight,
      he was confronted with the prospect that he would lose his wife.
      Throughout his life Olin had had a strong interest in horses and derived considerable pleasure from
      Shirley's ability as a rider and her many successes in showjumping. He served on the Committee of the
      Gisborne A&P Society and was in due course appointed to the Judge's List. This resulted in invitations to
      judge Hacks and Jumping events at A&P Shows throughout the
      country and gave him considerable pleasure. Had it not been for Lucy's illness he would almost certainly
      have been able to pursue this interest much further. Early in the War his ability as a judge of horses was
      recognised by the Army. Strange as it may seem, the military establishment in New Zealand contemplated the
      use of Mounted Rifles and a large number of horses were required in an urgent sense. These were to be
      conscripted and Olin, amongst others, was given the task of selecting suitable animals. Horses were still
      in universal use on the larger sheep stations and Olin travelled quite extensively in order to pick up the
      necessary numbers. On some properties the offering was large and varied. After sorting the sound from the
      unsound, Olin's next requirement was that the horses should be shown to be tractable enough to be ridden.
      In some instances this produced a further drastic reduction in the offering! It is understood that the
      Army's equestrian adventure was comparatively short lived and that most animals found their way back to
      where they came from.
      After Lucy died Olin married again and lived quietly in the Gisborne district until he died in 1967.

      Shirley b. at Waiohika. Address: 8 Pukeko St, Woodlands, Waikanae 6454.
      Shirley was educated by correspondence and at Gisborne High School. In 1938 she went to England to
      gain experience in the fashion industry and was there at the outbreak of WW2. She first joined the
      Field Ambulance Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) and subsequently the ATS, in which she was commissioned. At
      the end of the War she held the rank of Junior Commander. Returning to New Zealand in 1945, she held a
      position as manager of a factory owned by a company called Fashions Ltd, located in New Plymouth. In
      1952 she went overseas again and on her return established her own business in Hawkes Bay. She lived
