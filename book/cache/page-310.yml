      WILLIAMS, Henry (Hal) and WILLIAMS, Cecil Margaret (cont...)
      a speech by Captain Darling at the London Chamber of Commerce:
      "He would never forget his first visit to Smithfield Meat Market where he saw meat dropped down in sawdust,
      thrown into a filthy handcart, shot onto a dirty cart with a dirty boy sitting on top of the load.
      "The meat produced under excellent conditions in Canada had suffered more within 36 hours of its arrival in
      Liverpool and London's Smithfield than in ten or twelve days from the time it was killed in Canada and
      delivered at Liverpool." He went on to suggest that, if the general public had the ghost of an idea of the
      conditions in British slaughterhouses, they would eat only cleanly produced and properly inspected imported

      meat.
      In 1929 he designed and supervised the construction of the Sheffield Corporation meat abattoir and wholesale
      meat market. This was a milestone in meat abattoirs and public health, embodying the latest principles of
      modern meatworks practice. By the time of Hal's death the Government had replaced some 16,000 slaughterhouses
      with 800 larger killing centres. Hal was appointed Consulting Engineer to the New Zealand Government on food
      refrigeration and transport in London. From 1940 until his death he was in charge of the design and
      construction of 24 underground emergency cold stores for safeguarding Britain's perishable food supplies for
      the Ministry of Food.

      He was the author of "Mechanical Refrigeration", the standard text on the subject. It was first published in
      1903 and ran to five editions before his death. He was also the author of the refrigeration section of Kempe's
      Engineers' Year Book.
      Hal was a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers from 1897 when he was elected a Graduate. He was
      transferred to Associate Membership in 1899, and to Membership in 1905. He was also a member of the Institute
      of Electrical Engineers. He took a lively interest in the Cold Storage and Ice Association which later became
      the British Association of Refrigeration. He served as its Vice President for a period and supported the
      International Institute of Refrigeration from its first Congress in Paris in 1908.

      Hal's firm was also interested in arbitration work in connection with technical disputes; Hal himself served on
      the panel of arbitration for the American Chamber of Commerce in London. He was also prominent in the formation
      of the Secret Commissions and Bribery Prevention League and was for many years a member of its Council.
      Cecil went to England in 1911 to marry Hal. She had become engaged to Hal in New Zealand on his only return
      visit here. She was given away by Sir William Russell. They lived at No 6 Holly Place, Hampstead until 1914
      then moved to 28 Frognal Lane, Hampstead. Later they moved to 43 Bedford Square and lived over the offices,
      with the pressure of Hal's work. After the war Cecil lived at 27 Lindfield Gardens, Hampstead and latterly, at
      Durrants Hotel, Manchester Square.
      Hal and Cecil played an active part in providing a home away from home for many New Zealand servicemen and New
      Zealanders studying in Britain. Hal was involved with the Church of St Lawrence Jewry, the New Zealanders'
      church in London. Cecil presented the New Zealand flag at a commemorative service of the signing of the Treaty
      of Waitangi on 06 February 1934. He played a leading part in the New Zealand Association (Chairman in 1928). He
      used to organise Christ's College gatherings in London and was a founder of the New Zealand Masonic Lodge
      there.
      Cecil played a leading role in the New Zealand Women's Association, being Vice President in 1934 and, with Hal,
      was prominent in the formation of the New Zealand War Services Association at the outbreak of WW2. Cecil always
      entertained many visitors from New Zealand and kept in touch through a large correspondence.
      Hal was an active member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He gave a spirited performance in a
      celebration pageant in the Albert Hall, according to the Times of 10.07.1930.
      He was awarded the King's Jubilee Medal in 1935.
      His obituary in "The Engineer" states that "His death robs the world of an engineer of exceptional experience
      and sound practical judgement." It may be added that his work in both wars, and between them, was of the utmost
      strategic importance to Britain's survival.
