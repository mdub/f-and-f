      1914. In 1897 Sydney took up "Pakihiroa" station on his own account. Besides being a successful
      pioneer and developer in his own right, Sydney was more than generous with practical and financial assistance
      for many of the early Maori and European farmers of the East Coast. His contribution to responsible development
      to the district was acknowledged by Sir Apirana Ngata in a speech to the House of Representatives in 1915.
      Sydney served for a number of years on the Waiapu County Council and was also a director of the Gisborne
      Publishing Co Ltd.
      Agnes acted as medical adviser in the district, and was responsible for teaching many young girls of the
      district the rudiments of good housekeeping. She was renowned for her hospitality to travellers.

      Tuparoa
      The leasehold of the "Tuparoa" block of 20,000 acres was first taken up by Sir George Whitmore. He built the
      original homestead at Kuhirerere. However, Whitmore did not have the expertise to develop the heavy manuka and
      tauhina which covered this country, so in 1892, the lease was taken over by Samuel Williams. In 1894 Samuel
      brought his nephew, Thomas Sydney Williams, from the Bay of Islands to manage "Tuparoa" for him. Thomas
      accomplished the development of "Tuparoa" in about ten years, and had, by then taken over the lease from
      Samuel. When Thomas arrived "Tuparoa" was covered in manuka, tauhinu and fern, with no roads or bridges or
      development of any kind. When he handed it back to the owners in 1914 it was all clear grassland and in full
      production.
      Included in "Tuparoa" was 400 acres of freehold which Whitmore had acquired. This was known as "Kaharau" and
      it was here that Thomas built his beautiful homestead.
      Shortly after the return of "Tuparoa', the Williams family was subjected to criticism in the House of
      Representatives in connection with their land dealings. In their defence, Sir Apirana Ngata spoke as follows:
      "I was out of the House when the Honourable Member for Grey Lynn made his speech, but I understand that the
      burden of his remarks was an attack on the land-owning missionaries of this Dominion, and that special
      reference was made to the Williams family. I cannot allow these remarks to pass without putting on record an
      appreciation from the Natives of my district - and I think from the Maori people as a whole - of what the

      Williams family has done for them. I want to disabuse the minds of the honourable members, as far as my
      district is concerned, of the impression that the Williams family has obtained large areas of land from the
      Natives of that district by unfair means or the exercise of undue influence. I think I can say that no land
      was bought by members of the Williams family direct from the Natives of the Waiapu district, except small
      sections that were the residue of old purchases that were scattered through the lands owned by the Williamses.
      I can bear testimony to what the Williamses have done, and their relation to the Natives of the Waiapu County.
      The Tuparoa Run, the leasehold of which expired a few months ago, was acquired from a member of the Williams
      family from Colonel Whitmore, who held a lease from the Native owners. In the short time he administered that
      country he affected vast improvements in it, and it reverted to the Natives in good condition. The Tuparoa Run
      was something to speak about with a good deal of pride, as showing the good work done on it and the class of
      farming that was carried out by Mr Thomas Sydney Williams. The Matahiia and Taparoa properties were acquired
      by the Williams family in the same indirect manner. The only land acquired directly from the Natives by way of
      lease was the Waipiro Run. It was acquired by Mr J NWilliams something like thirty or thirty two years ago."

      Kaharau
      Situated on the main road two miles from Ruatoria, "Kaharau" freehold comprised 300 acres of hill country and
      100 acres of flat, in addition to other small areas of leasehold land. "Kaharau" was initially used as a
      finishing property for stock from "Pakihiroa", and as headquarters for the six eight-horse teams of draught
      horses which serviced "Pakihiroa". Oats for chaff for the horses were grown on the flats. Both Thomas and his
