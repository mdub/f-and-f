      b 24.11.1942
      Address: Riverslea Road, Hastings.
      Judy was educated at Elsthorpe Primary School, Queenswood School, Woodford House and Victoria
      University. She was at Queenswood when it was just becoming a Rudolf Steiner school and later became
      the first ex-pupil to have received Steiner education there and to return as a teacher. At Woodford,
      she was music prefect and developed a lifelong interest in the piano, particularly Beethoven's piano
      works. After leaving school, she embarked on nursing training at Hastings Memorial Hospital, but left
      before completing the full course though she subsequently worked at the National Women's Hospital in
      Sydney.
      After a short spell in Australia, she travelled to London, where she joined the staff of the Tavistock
      Institute and worked as a research assistant to RD Laing and Aaron Esterson. This work resulted in
      books including Laing & Esterson's "Sanity, Madness & the Family" and Laing, Esterson & Phillips'
      "Interpersonal Perception". At this stage she had no formal training in psychology and so returned to
      New Zealand in the mid-1960s to study for a BA at Victoria University. During this period, she
      married David and suspended her university studies when Mark was born,
      Later, over a number of years, she pursued her interest in psychology through encounter groups and
      training in several forms of psychotherapy, including gestalt, psychodrama and transactional analysis.
      This enabled her to take up counselling work, which she continued for many years, at times on a
      full-time basis but mostly part-time. As an antidote to the isolation of suburban living, the family
      joined several experiments in community living, both urban and rural. When Judy's mother Kath became
      ill in 1975, the family moved to Hawke's Bay where both Judy and David eventually became teachers at
      the former Queenswood School, by now the Rudolf Steiner School, Hastings.
      Judy taught drama and choir and from this time became interested in Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy.
      This led her into organisational work where she worked with other consultants to various public
      companies, government organisations and Steiner schools to assist them develop and improve their social
      processes.
      She nursed a close friend, and later her father, and these experiences lead Judy into working with the
      dying. She subsequently nursed several other people through the final days of their lives.
      David graduated BSc(Hons) from Victoria University. He was a publisher's editor for several years
      followed by several years of market gardening. He was a class teacher (primary) at the Rudolf Steiner
      School, Hastings for ten years, and is now Executive Secretary of the Bio Dynamic Farming and Gardening
      Association in New Zealand (Inc).
