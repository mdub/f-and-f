      Maria b. at Waimate and d. at Hukarere, Napier.
      Maria was Lady Superintendent of Hukarere Girls' School which first opened at Hukarere Road,
      Napier in 1875. She kept the accounts and conducted the correspondence of the school from its
      inception and generally supervised the matron and teachers until these duties were taken over by
      the officers of the Te Aute Trust Board in 1911.

      Maria with her sisters, Lydia and Marianne were known within the family as the Hukarere Aunts.
      The following is a memoir on these three ladies, written in 1973 by their grandniece, Bettie Williams:
      'I was often taken to visit the Hukarere Aunts, the unmarried sisters of my grandfather, JN Williams. Even
      then they seemed like something out of another age and dressed much as their mother would have done - always in
      black and in a simplified version of the style of the 1890's. This was in the second decade of the 20th
      Century. The black was unrelieved except for a little white ruff at the neck and a frilled white lace cap. Aunt

      Marianne, the youngest, wore no cap and a long-sleeved blouse in a fine granny print with her plain black
      skirt. Aunt Maria would have been in her seventies and, though she lived to be ninety, seemed to us very old.
      Tiny, fragile and crippled with arthritis, she walked with a stick and spent most of her time on a horse-hair
      sofa or the cane and mahogany couch now in Waipare Gran's bedroom, not very comfortable for old bones. Aunt
      Kate, two years younger, was the lively one. Tall, thin and vivacious, I believe she had been very beautiful in
      her youth. She spent her life in good works and taught for some years at the Hukarere Maori Girls' College. We
      loved her and she took great pains to make our visits fun. Always a party tea round the dining room table -
      bread and butter with hundreds and thousands and a little cut glass dish of boiled sweets for each child. A
      cupboard full of dolls and other toys, the home-made bricks we have at Hapua among them. They were given to Jon
      by Aunt Marianne. The house was dark and very Victorian - horsehair and bamboo, probably much as in their
      parents' day. Aunt Kate died in 1931 after she was injured in the Cathedral wrecked by the earthquake in
      February of that year, a few weeks before Jon's birth and two years after the death of Maria. Marianne died the
      following year. Aunt Kate once stayed with us at Atua, I think after my father died. I remember her in a
      voluminous apron, lace cap and all, making cherry jam,
