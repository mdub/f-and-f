      River district. In 1905 he was appointed Superintendent of Maori Mission work throughout the five Maori
      Pastorates of the Wellington Diocese but he continued to live at Putiki until 1913 when they moved to 115
      Liverpool Street, Wanganui, and his eldest son, Wilfrid became Superintendent of the Maori Mission in his
      place. Alfred, who had been made Honorary Canon of Wellington Cathedral, retired in 1920. He continued to help
      with the Christian ministry in Wanganui and Putiki. He died from pneumonia after catching a severe chill and is
      buried in Aramoho Cemetery, Wanganui.

      In 1883 his parents moved to Te Rau Theological College, Gisborne. Two years later
      they moved to the Mission House at Putiki, Wanganui and here Wilfrid spent the whole of his boyhood. He
      attended Wanganui Collegiate School and won prizes in Latin and Greek. In 1902 he enrolled at Canterbury
      University College to study for his BA degree. During his vacations he worked long hours on a dairy farm,
      milking some 30-40 cows by hand twice a day. In this way he paid for his boarding fees at College House, a
      residential college for ordination candidates. While at University he won, in 1903, an Exhibition in
      Natural Science. He also became treasurer of the newly-formed Australasian Christian Union in 1905.
      In 1906 his great-uncle, Samuel Williams, paid for him to go to Ridley Hall, Cambridge to complete his
      theological studies. Here he won the Cambridge Divinity Testimonium. He continued his interest in botany
      during the long vacations by making a study of (a) the wild flowers of Switzerland and (b) the wild flowers
      of Iceland. He worked his way to and from Iceland on a British trawler.
      Wilfrid was ordained deacon in 1908 and for the next two years he was curate at St James', Hatcham, London.
      Here he was ordained priest in 1909. Like his father, he was a frequent visitor to Southwell and here he
      met Madeline Chalk, a first cousin, as her mother, Agnes Gaster, was a sister of Wilfrid's mother, Alice.
      The couple were married in 1910 and sailed for New Zealand soon afterwards.

      Wilfrid became vicar of the Wanganui Parochial District which included Turakina, Wangaehu, Mangamahu,
      Fordell and Upokongaro. The vicarage was at Matarawa and they covered their big district in a horse-drawn
      open trap. An accident with the trap resulted in their first child, a daughter, being still-born.
      In 1913 Wilfrid, who spoke Maori fluently, was appointed Superintendent of the Maori Mission in the
      Wellington Diocese, and came to live in Wanganui. During the 1914-18 war he often took services in the
      Mangaweka, Hunterville, Ohingaiti and Kawhatau district in addition to his Maori Mission work. He travelled
      great distances in all weathers on a Douglas motorbike.
      In 1918 the church at Koriniti on the Wanganui River was destroyed by the Raetihi fire. Wilfrid played an
      active part in building a new church in 1919 which is still in use today. In 1925 he assisted in the
      building of a Mission House at Koriniti as a home for a missionary nurse. Sister Beswick pioneered this
      work and was followed in 1930 by Sister Elsie. The latter worked indefatigably for the next thirty years
      riding or walking or canoeing great distances to attend patients. She was awarded the CBE. Wilfrid was the
      one who saw the need for this and similar projects. In the 1930's he, together with Sir Apirana Ngata,
      began to plan the building of a new church at Putiki which would be truly representative of Maori worship.
