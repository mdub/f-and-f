      call this the "Karewa" Block; it is run in conjunction with "Matahiia". Jeremy returned home in 1980 and
      became manager in 1985. On the night of his wedding, 08 November 1986, the Matahiia Homestead was burnt down
      by Rastafarian arsonists.
      In 1984 Stuart Williams sold "Taitai" station to the Government for forestry and in 1987 he sold
      "Mangarewarewa" to "Matahiia", which became the new "Matahiia" homestead. This meant that this block became
      once again the property of "Matahiia".
      In March 1988, "Matahiia" station, like many other East Coast properties, was hit by Cyclone Bola causing
      extensive damage to the land. A month later a group of Ruatoria arsonists burnt down the old kauri woolshed
      and various other buildings.
      Jeremy and Jane Williams now live on the "Matahiia "block, and Tim and Samantha Williams live on the "Karewa"
      block which is run in conjunction with "Matahiia" station.
