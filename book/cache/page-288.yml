      CACCIA-BIRCH, Margaret Jennifer (Jendy) and ROBINSON, Stephen Elsworth (cont...)
      School for Boys, East Brisbane. She is now retired, except for a few private students. Her chief
      interests are music, genealogy, and gardening.
      Stephen was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Ashbourne, Derbyshire, UK and in 1945 he
      followed his parents to New Zealand. He worked with the Civil Aviation Administration before moving to
      Australia, where he sang with the Queensland Light Opera Company. Stephen took his family on annual
      camping safaris from the eastern seaboard to the deserts of Central Australia and later, with his son,
      pioneered the use of ultralight aircraft, mustering in outback Queensland. He was a broadcaster with
      Radio 4MBS (a classical music station in Brisbane) for three years, until his retirement. He now reads
      and sings in the local Anglican Church, and takes a keen interest in all matters to do with aircraft,
      and is presently a member of the Queensland Ultralight Association.
