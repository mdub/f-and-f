      and, in Napier, from 1945 until taking up farming. He
      served in Greece, North Africa and Italy with the 2nd NZEF 25 and 22 Battalions (1940-45), and was
      promoted to the rank of Captain (Acting Major). In Greece he and his brother John together manned a
      light machine-gun in the Anti Aircraft Platoon. During the 19-day retreat from the Aliakmon Line,
      north of Mount Olympus, their task was to engage low-flying Stuka dive-bombers and fighter-bombers
      attacking the crowded road convoy, in the slim hope of repelling them. Their unit was part of the
      final evacuation of New Zealand troops at Monemvasia in the far south of the Peloponnese. This
      involved sliding down a rock face by rope in the small hours to reach the craft that ferried them to
      the destroyer "Griffin" of the Royal Navy.
      Jim's lengthy war service saw him rise from Private in the Headquarters Company of one battalion to
      Officer Commanding the Headquarters Company of the other.
      From 1947 he was manager of "Te Aute" station until his retirement to Havelock North in 1979. He was
      Chairman of the Te Aute Trust Board, Chairman of the Te Aute College Board of Governors, Chairman of
      the Henry and William Williams Memorial Trust Inc, member of the Parish Vestry and Synod, member of the
      Pihopatanga O Aotearoa Trust Board and member of Te Runanganui O Te Pihopatanga 0 Aotearoa,
      Jean was educated at Woodford House. She served on the Woodford House Trust Board. She is active in
      Anglican Church life, is a member of Te Runanganui 0 Te Pihopatanga 0 Aotearoa and continues to take
      the leadership role which she and Jim shared in the educational thrust of the Church towards
      bi-cultural development and partnership. She is a keen gardener and musician.
