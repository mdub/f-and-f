      LUDBROOK, Henry Samuel (Harry) and KINSELLA, Hana (cont...)
      joined the staff of the Southern Cross and later, the New Zealand Herald. An active social worker, Hana was
      President of the Women's Institute and the Red Cross Society in Paihia during WW2 and was one of the oldest
      women to do her VAD training by doing forty hours voluntary nursing in a public hospital when well into her
      seventies.
      Both Harry and Hana were active members of the Church of England. Harry was a lay reader and vestryman and a
      synodsman for forty years and Hana played the organ. They gave the land for the Ohaeawai Church and helped
      raise the money to build it. The altar is dedicated to their son, Hereward Reginald, who was killed in WW1.

      University graduating MB ChB in 1919. He was a house surgeon at Auckland Hospital for two years, then a
      locum for a Dr Davis on the East Coast for a year. There he attended his patients in a Model T Ford or on

      before commencing practice as a consulting physician. He had a particular interest in the welfare of
      children, and from 1940, limited his practice to paediatrics only. In 1950 he became a fellow of the Royal
      College of Physicians, London, and he was a foundation member of the Royal Australasian College of
      Physicians (1939). When the Paediatric Society of New Zealand was founded in 1974, he was the first
      president.
      Sam played a leading role in ensuring the establishment of the Princess Mary Hospital for Children at
      Auckland Hospital in 1949, and was a consultant advisor to the Crippled Children Society in Auckland. He
      was made CMG in 1970 in recognition of his services to paediatrics.
      Sam's other interests included trout fishing, tennis, horse racing and golf.
