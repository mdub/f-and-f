      Lois b. at Gisborne and m. at Holy Trinity Church, Gisborne, Selwyn, s/o Lawrence Montgomery (Larry)
      Davis and Katherine Helen Smith. Address: 10 Sedgewick Road, Opotiki.
      Lois was educated at Wellington Correspondence School and Gisborne High School. She was taught art by
      her aunt Lydia Christine Watkins and Eric Gully and spent four years studying art at Canterbury
      University. She has a Diploma of Fine Arts (1945) and is a life member of the Gisborne Art Society.
      Selwyn was educated at Whakarau School. He saw active service in an Anti Tank Regiment in WW2 and on
      his return he took over as a trustee running "Tawa", "Pukekiwi" and "Kaipono" stations. When Selwyn's
      father, Larry Davis returned from the Boer War he worked for the Williamses until he was financed by
      either KS Williams or TS Williams onto "Tawa" station up Whakarau Road 40 miles north of Gisborne. He
      later bought "Pukekiwi" and "Kaipono" stations. Some time after Larry's death the Estate of L M Davis
      bought "Whakarau" station and this was divided into shares on the death of his widow, Katherine. Selwyn
      then owned "Tawa" and a share of "Whakarau" with his brother, Ronald Alexander Davis.
