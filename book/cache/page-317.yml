      B Hutton, Vicar of the Church of St John. Harry b. at Tottenham, England.
      Anna was 15 when her mother died and her father, who was in poor health, returned to
      England. She lived with her uncle, Hugh Carleton and helped him in the writing of his
      book on the life of Henry Williams. She also lived for a time with another uncle,

      Christopher Davies, who was a doctor, and from him she learned much about the care of
      the sick. In 1879 she was at Pakaraka caring for her grandmother, Marianne, and was present at her death, which
      she describes in great detail in a moving letter to her Aunt Lydia, wife of Hugh Carleton (letter in the
      Auckland Institute and Museum Library, Ms 335 Williams from Letters '73'). In 1884 Anna went to England with a
      cousin to accompany a boy to an English boarding school. On the ship she met Harry who was ship's engineer and
      they were married shortly after their arrival in England. Her stepmother was one of the witnesses.
      Harry founded the firm of Henry Branch & Sons, engineers and ironfounders at Runcorn, Cheshire. Anna's
      granddaughter, Joan Watson remembers her as a 'perfect lady'; very like the portrait of her mother; tall,
      good-looking even in old age, straight-backed with beautiful hair and always well groomed. She had a great
      sense of fun and was a fine storyteller to her grandchildren, relating her early life in New Zealand with love
      and nostalgia. Her life with Harry had many ups and downs - he was a volatile and chauvinistic man - but she
      was calm, strong and resourceful and seemed to be able to cure all ailments, cook all foods and make anything
      that may be needed. Always dependable, she was a true 'survivor'. The one big disappointment of her life was
      that Harry never fulfilled his wedding promise to take her back to the land of her birth to see her family.
