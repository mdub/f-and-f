1 CONT Henry b. at Kingston, Portsea nr Gosport, England, d, and bd. at Pakaraka. Marianne, d/o
1 CONT Wright Coldham and Anne Temple, b. at Yorkshire, England, d. and bd. at Pakaraka.
1 CONT At the age of fourteen Henry joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman and saw action in
1 CONT several battles of the period before retiring on half pay in 1815. He worked for a short
1 CONT time as a drawing master until the time of his marriage when he came under the influence
1 CONT - of his brother-in-law, Rev E G Marsh of the Church Missionary Society. In 1820 he moved
1 CONT to Hampstead to study for Holy Orders and was ordained in June, 1822. Later that year he left with Marianne and
1 CONT their three children on the convict ship Lord Sidmouth, spent several months in Sydney, then continued on to New
1 CONT Zealand on the Brampton, arriving at the Bay of Islands on 03 August 1823.
1 CONT Henry assumed leadership of the New Zealand Mission and for the next 17 years he directed the steady extension of
1 CONT Christian influence amongst the Maoris. Shortly after his arrival he built a raupo church, the first in New
1 CONT Zealand, at Paihia. This was replaced by a lath and plaster building in 1827 and by a wooden church in 1856, The
1 CONT present Church of St Paul was built by the Williams family in 1923 on the site of the original raupo chapel as a
1 CONT memorial to the work of Henry and his brother, William.
1 CONT Conversions were slow in the earlier years of the Mission. Warfare amongst the Maori tribes was rife and the sale
1 CONT of firearms was instrumental in making the conflicts particularly bloody. Henry devoted enormous energy to the
1 CONT mediation of differences and by persuasion and courage he was often able to bring a peace, or at least a temporary
1 CONT truce. Known as Te Wiremu, he gained the deep respect of many of the Maori chiefs and, over time, had a
1 CONT considerable influence on their activities.
1 CONT In 1826 Henry built a 55 ton schooner, the Herald, to enable him the better to provision the mission station and to
1 CONT more easily visit the more remote areas of New Zealand. She was wrecked in 1828 near the Hokianga Heads. During
1 CONT the 1830s new mission stations were established at Tauranga, Rotorua, Waikato and Otaki and Henry travelled widely
1 CONT in order to minister to them. In 1839 he sailed by schooner with Octavius Hadfield to set up the Otaki mission and
1 CONT on the way they sought shelter at Port Nicholson where he met Edward Gibbon Wakefield. He visited Te Rauparaha on
1 CONT Kapiti island and then travelled overland by foot to Tauranga.
1 CONT When Captain Hobson arrived in New Zealand in 1840 Henry played a pivotal role in persuading the Maori chiefs of
1 CONT the northern districts to sign the Treaty of Waitangi and he later travelled throughout the North Island explaining
1 CONT the Treaty and obtaining additional signatures.
1 CONT Following the establishment of British rule, Henry's advice and assistance was sought by Governor Fitzroy and by
1 CONT Bishop Selwyn who installed him as Archdeacon of Waimate in 1844, Sir George Grey, however, was jealous of Henry's
1 CONT influence amongst the Maoris and proceeded over the next few years to undermine his position and publicly discredit
1 CONT him. To provide for the future of his children, Henry had purchased 11,000 acres of land at Pakaraka and this
1 CONT became the focus of charges by Grey and others that Henry was involved in land speculation. He was dismissed by
1 CONT the Church Missionary Society in 1849 and he and Marianne left Paihia to live at Pakaraka where his sons were
1 CONT farming. Here he built a church and continued to minister to his very large following of Maori adherents. In 1854
1 CONT he was reinstated by the CMS but remained at Pakaraka.
1 CONT In his final hours, Henry learned of a bitter dispute between two local tribes over the possession of an old pa.
1 CONT He sent his son, Edward to intervene but fighting continued until the warring parties learnt of Henry's death. A
1 CONT truce was declared and the two sides subsequently made a lasting peace.
1 CONT Before their departure for New Zealand, Marianne trained as a maternity nurse and studied the Moravian Methods of
1 CONT teaching and Organisation. She played a leading role in the establishment and running of the mission schools and
1 CONT provided care and comfort for those of the mission who suffered illness.

1 CONT Hugh was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, then studied Law at Middle Temple, London. After
1 CONT studying classical art in Italy, and travelling for three years, he arrived in Auckland in 1845. He was
1 CONT involved in various trading ventures between New Zealand and Australia and around the Pacific before entering
1 CONT politics. He was elected to the General Assembly in 1853 as representative for the Bay of Islands and served
1 CONT continuously until 1870,
1 CONT He was interested in music and higher education and was a prolific writer. He helped to found the Auckland
1 CONT Choral Society and the University of New Zealand and served as the first Vice-Chancellor of the latter
1 CONT organisation from 1871 to 1878. He was editor of the newspaper, "Southern Cross" and he wrote "A Page from the
1 CONT History of New Zealand" under the pen name of Metoikos. This was a defence of Henry Williams against the
1 CONT charges of land aggregation being levelled against him at the time. He also wrote "The Life of Henry Williams"
1 CONT in two volumes published in 1874 and 1877. This work was edited and revised by James Elliott in 1948.

1 CONT (1788-1837), d, and bd, at Pukehou, Jane's family were descendants of the Irish family of
1 CONT O'Donnell, Kings of Ireland. Her father landed at Paihia on 15.08.1824 as a missionary
1 CONT agriculturalist and moved to Waimate in 1831 to establish a farm there. He was ordained
1 CONT na deacon by Bishop Selwyn on 11.06.1843 and moved to Kaikohe Mission Station in 1845. He
1 CONT retired to Waimate in 1854.
1 CONT Edward came to Paihia, Bay of Islands in August 1823 with his missionary parents. He was educated by them and later
1 CONT at the Mission School, Waimate North. He returned to England on HMS "Buffalo" in 1834 to complete his education. He
1 CONT became seriously ill in 1839 and was sent back to New Zealand. With his brother, Samuel, he took over the
1 CONT management of the family farm at Pakaraka. He became a brilliant Maori linguist and an expert in the Ngapuhi
1 CONT dialect. In February 1840 he assisted his father to translate the Treaty of Waitangi into Maori. Later that year he
1 CONT sailed on HMS "Herald" (under Captain Nias) with Major Bunbury of the 80th Regiment, on a voyage to southern Maori
1 CONT districts where he acted as official interpreter of the Treaty to Maori chiefs. The signatures of the chiefs were
1 CONT witnessed by these three men in Coromandel Harbour, Mercury Bay, Cloudy Bay (near Blenheim), Otakou (Otago), the
1 CONT island of Ruapuke in Fouveaux Strait, Kapiti Island and Hawke's Bay. On this voyage Major Bunbury raised the
1 CONT British flag and declared sovereignty over the South Island in Cloudy Bay on 17 June 1840 and in Stewart Island
1 CONT later that same month.
1 CONT In July 1841 Edward was appointed as a Director of the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd, opened in New Zealand in
1 CONT 1840. Later he and Jane settled on part of the family farm at Puketona. The house they built is still lived in
1 CONT today. He took services regularly at Pakaraka and frequently acted as mediator between Maori tribes and between
1 CONT Maori and Pakeha in land disputes. Edward became Resident Magistrate for the Bay of Islands extensive district in
1 CONT 1861. He administered the Runanga (Maori court) system with great skill and fairness (refer "A Show of Fairness" by
1 CONT Dr Alan Ward, pp 137-140) and promoted the establishment of Maori village schools. In 1881 he was appointed a Judge
1 CONT of the Native Land Court and moved to Auckland. He retired in the late 1880's and moved to Pukehou, Hawkes Bay
1 CONT where his brother, Samuel, had built a house for him called "Roxton". Here he translated more than 200 A&M hymns

1 CONT Henry b. at Puketona (between Paihia and Pakaraka) and d. at Dunedin.
1 CONT Henry trained in surveying and had a family background in administration and law. He is known to
1 CONT have been in Poverty Bay in early November 1868 to discuss loan finance (or surveys or
1 CONT insurance) with settlers. He rode out from Turanga (now Gisborne) to visit Messrs Dodd and
1 CONT Peppard on their run at Repongaere. Their discussion was apparently inconclusive and Henry
1 CONT returned to Turanga and took passage to Auckland. A few days later Dodd and Peppard were
1 CONT murdered in their home by some of Te Kooti's men on their way to the Poverty Bay Massacre.
1 CONT In 1873 the National Insurance Company was founded with its head office in Dunedin and in June 1875 Henry was
1 CONT appointed their Auckland manager. He was also active in the Church in Auckland and, in September 1881, he was
1 CONT presented with a mantle eight-day clock by Friends of St Sepulchres just prior to his transfer to Dunedin as
1 CONT Manager. In 1885 Henry was sent to San Francisco to resolve some problems for the Company and in 1890, by which
1 CONT time he was Assistant General Manager, he was sent on a similar mission to London. When he returned he assumed
1 CONT the post of General Manager of the Company, and in 1892 this was confirmed. Early in 1914 he intimated to the
1 CONT Board that he proposed to retire but, with the outbreak of WW1, his retirement was delayed until the end of
1 CONT 1918, by which time he was aged 75. Henry had given 43 years service to the National Insurance Company, 26 of

1 CONT and Agnes both bd. at Kaharau, Ruatoria.
1 CONT After farming for some years on the Williams family property at Pakaraka, Bay of Islands, Sydney
1 CONT came to Ruatoria, East Coast in 1894. He took over the management of "Tuparoa" station for his
1 CONT uncle, Samuel Williams, then took over the lease from Samuel, retaining it until its expiry in
1 CONT 1914. In 1897 Sydney took up "Pakihiroa" station on his own account. Besides being a successful
1 CONT pioneer and developer in his own right, Sydney was more than generous with practical and financial assistance
1 CONT for many of the early Maori and European farmers of the East Coast. His contribution to responsible development
1 CONT to the district was acknowledged by Sir Apirana Ngata in a speech to the House of Representatives in 1915.
1 CONT Sydney served for a number of years on the Waiapu County Council and was also a director of the Gisborne
1 CONT Publishing Co Ltd.
1 CONT Agnes acted as medical adviser in the district, and was responsible for teaching many young girls of the
1 CONT district the rudiments of good housekeeping. She was renowned for her hospitality to travellers.
1 CONT Tuparoa
1 CONT The leasehold of the "Tuparoa" block of 20,000 acres was first taken up by Sir George Whitmore. He built the
1 CONT original homestead at Kuhirerere. However, Whitmore did not have the expertise to develop the heavy manuka and
1 CONT tauhina which covered this country, so in 1892, the lease was taken over by Samuel Williams. In 1894 Samuel
1 CONT brought his nephew, Thomas Sydney Williams, from the Bay of Islands to manage "Tuparoa" for him. Thomas
1 CONT accomplished the development of "Tuparoa" in about ten years, and had, by then taken over the lease from
1 CONT Samuel. When Thomas arrived "Tuparoa" was covered in manuka, tauhinu and fern, with no roads or bridges or
1 CONT development of any kind. When he handed it back to the owners in 1914 it was all clear grassland and in full
1 CONT production.
1 CONT Included in "Tuparoa" was 400 acres of freehold which Whitmore had acquired. This was known as "Kaharau" and
1 CONT it was here that Thomas built his beautiful homestead.
1 CONT Shortly after the return of "Tuparoa", the Williams family was subjected to criticism in the House of
1 CONT Representatives in connection with their land dealings. In their defence, Sir Apirana Ngata spoke as follows:
1 CONT "I was out of the House when the Honourable Member for Grey Lynn made his speech, but I understand that the
1 CONT burden of his remarks was an attack on the land-owning missionaries of this Dominion, and that special
1 CONT reference was made to the Williams family. I cannot allow these remarks to pass without putting on record an
1 CONT appreciation from the Natives of my district - and I think from the Maori people as a whole - of what the
1 CONT Williams family has done for them. I want to disabuse the minds of the honourable members, as far as my
1 CONT district is concerned, of the impression that the Williams family has obtained large areas of land from the
1 CONT Natives of that district by unfair means or the exercise of undue influence. I think I can say that no land
1 CONT was bought by members of the Williams family direct from the Natives of the Waiapu district, except small
1 CONT sections that were the residue of old purchases that were scattered through the lands owned by the Williamses.
1 CONT I can bear testimony to what the Williamses have done, and their relation to the Natives of the Waiapu County.
1 CONT The Tuparoa Run, the leasehold of which expired a few months ago, was acquired from a member of the Williams
1 CONT family from Colonel Whitmore, who held a lease from the Native owners. In the short time he administered that
1 CONT country he affected vast improvements in it, and it reverted to the Natives in good condition. The Tuparoa Run
1 CONT was something to speak about with a good deal of pride, as showing the good work done on it and the class of
1 CONT farming that was carried out by Mr Thomas Sydney Williams. The Matahiia and Taparoa properties were acquired
1 CONT by the Williams family in the same indirect manner. The only land acquired directly from the Natives by way of
1 CONT lease was the Waipiro Run. It was acquired by Mr J NWilliams something like thirty or thirty two years ago."
1 CONT Kaharau
1 CONT Situated on the main road two miles from Ruatoria, "Kaharau" freehold comprised 300 acres of hill country and
1 CONT 100 acres of flat, in addition to other small areas of leasehold land. "Kaharau" was initially used as a
1 CONT finishing property for stock from "Pakihiroa", and as headquarters for the six eight-horse teams of draught
1 CONT horses which serviced "Pakihiroa". Oats for chaff for the horses were grown on the flats. Both Thomas and his
1 CONT wife, Agnes Lydia, were buried in the garden cemetery of their "Kaharau" home. "Kaharau" was farmed as an

1 CONT | Christopher, slo George and Catherine Davies, b. at London, England, bap. on 22.05.1811 at
1 CONT St Marylebone's Church, Marylebone, London and d. at Paihia,
1 CONT Christopher commenced study at Trinity College, Dublin with a view to entering the service
1 CONT of the Church Missionary Society but ill-health caused him to abandon the course. From
1 CONT August 1833 to June 1834 he managed the pharmaceutical establishment of Dr Phelan and
1 CONT William Malone at Clonmel, County Cork. He then began his studies for the medical profession; from 1836 to 1838 at
1 CONT the Cork School of Physic and Surgery; then from 1839 to 1840 at the Cork School of Anatomy, Medicine and Surgery;
1 CONT the Cork Institute and Hospital for the Care of Pregnant Women and the Treatment of Illnesses of Women and Children
1 CONT and The Cork North Infirmary. In 1841 he spent three months at the School of Medicine of the Apothecaries Hall.
1 CONT Soon afterwards he sailed for New Zealand and arrived early in 1842 on the Kiti Kiti from Sydney. He set up
1 CONT practice as a surgeon in Kororareka and immediately took steps to fulfil his ambition to join the Church Missionary
1 CONT Society. He consulted with Bishop Selwyn, Henry Williams, William Williams, Alfred Brown and the Secretary of the
1 CONT Parent Committee. At the same time he sought the hand of Marianne Williams. Jane Williams wrote to say that she and
1 CONT William "were much pleased with him... he is a very decided character and clever in his profession". Henry also
1 CONT approved of him but wrote to A N Brown to say that "The young man is rather urgent in his demands and wants to
1 CONT carry her off earlier than we approve. We think about the commencement of the year." Christopher was accepted as a
1 CONT catechist and he and Marianne moved to Waimate where Marianne, with the help of Christopher and Elizabeth Colenso,
1 CONT took over responsibility for the Infant School. In September 1844 Christopher was ordained a Deacon at the Waimate
1 CONT Mission Station in the same ceremony that Henry Williams and Alfred Brown were inducted as Archdeacons. Soon
1 CONT afterwards he and Marianne moved to Te Papa Station at Tauranga where, for the next seven years, he assisted
1 CONT Archdeacon Brown. His pastoral duties included extensive and arduous travel throughout the district to Matamata,
1 CONT Maungatautari, Rotorua, Thames and Taupo. In 1852 Christopher and his family transferred to Opotiki to take over
1 CONT the station established by John Wilson. His work there also involved him in regular visitations to pas and villages
1 CONT as far east as Raukokore and inland to Te Whaiti and Waimana. During his frequent absences, responsibility for the
1 CONT Boarding School rested with Marianne. Christopher's health continued to deteriorate and in 1856 he left Opotiki for
1 CONT Auckland to seek medical advice. The advice was that he should leave Opotiki and move with his family to Paihia.
1 CONT This was nine years before the Rev Volkner was killed at Opotiki by the Hau Haus. He continued his missionary and
1 CONT medical work until his death in 1861.
1 CONT After the death of her mother, Anna Hutton lived with the Davies for some time. She related to her grandchildren
1 CONT how Christopher had a big bell on the roof of his house which was rung if a patient needed to see the doctor whilst
1 CONT he was out on his rounds. It could be heard from a great distance but, if the doctor did not hear it himself,
1 CONT someone would pass the message on to him.

1 CONT In 1872 he joined the Government Service in Wellington as an interpreter. He had previously acted for some

1 CONT understood some of the unedifying language heard outside the city pubs. He and Rose Alma would entertain Maori
1 CONT leaders and received gifts from them, including Maori cloaks.
1 CONT He displayed a keen interest in local affairs and was a member of the Karori School Committee for a number of

1 CONT Samuel b. at Hampstead, England and d. at Te Aute. Mary, d/o William Williams and Jane
1 CONT Neslon,
1 CONT Samuel was educated at the mission schools at Paihia and Waimate. In 1836 he took over his
1 CONT father's farm at Pakaraka until 1844 when he entered St John's College, Waimate, to
1 CONT prepare for holy orders. When the college moved to Tamaki he became senior bursar and
1 CONT assisted with the administration of the College farm and finances. He was ordained deacon
1 CONT in 1846, ten days before his marriage. In 1847 Samuel was appointed to take charge of the Otaki mission during the
1 CONT illness of Octavius Hadfield. There he organised an extensive educational establishment including boarding
1 CONT accommodation for 100 Maori boys, and a mission farm.
1 CONT Impressed with his work at Otaki, Samuel was requested by Governor Grey to set up a Maori school in Hawke's Bay.
1 CONT The move to Te Aute took place in 1854. An estate comprising some 7,000 acres was created from Government grants
1 CONT and land donated by Te Hapuku and others, and entrusted to the Bishop of New Zealand. The administration of the
1 CONT estate was vested in a board of trustees with Samuel being given power of attorney. The school was opened in 1854
1 CONT with twelve pupils, but closed again in 1859 due to shortage of funds, and the effects of a ruinous fire. Samuel
1 CONT then concentrated on developing the farm to provide a permanent source of income with which to assist with the
1 CONT funding of the school. During the early 1860s, using his own funds, then borrowing heavily, he cleared and fenced
1 CONT the land, and increased stock numbers. In 1869 Samuel sought to retain control over the management of the estate by
1 CONT leasing it from the trust. The lease was renewed in 1878, 1892 and 1903 with appropriate increases in rental, but
1 CONT Samuel was forced to defend his position against those who criticised the granting of private leases over
1 CONT educational trust land. However his stewardship was subsequently vindicated by a Royal Commission held in 1906.
1 CONT The College reopened in 1872 and concentrated on developing a high level of academic instruction. Samuel also
1 CONT played a role in the establishment of a Maori girls' school at Hukarere, Napier in 1875.
1 CONT Samuel was a fluent Maori speaker and wide knowledge of Maori culture. He had respect for their customs and a
1 CONT sympathy with their aspirations and fought tirelessly for their rights and their advancement. During the Hauhau
1 CONT uprising he challenged their beliefs in open debate and provided a stabilising influence on the unsettled Maori
1 CONT community of the time.
1 CONT To his family, Samuel is remembered as a benefactor who guided and assisted many of his relatives in the purchase
1 CONT and establishment of pastoral holdings in the Hawke's Bay and East Coast districts. When he died in 1907 he left an
1 CONT estate valued at 429,566 Pounds.

1 CONT Kenneth b. at Pakaraka. Lillian, d/o Samuel Blomfield Ludbrook and Caroline Elizabeth

1 CONT 1888, and was also in the 1st cricket XI. Ken arrived on the East Coast in 1894 and
1 CONT farmed sheep and cattle at "Matahiia", Ruatoria. In the early years of Wwi Ken, along
1 CONT with TS, HB and AB Williams, formed and financed the Waiapu Trust with the
1 CONT intention of financing the settlement of returned servicemen on the land. The Trust purchased the
1 CONT Whakaangiangi Block not far from Ruatoria and a number of ex-servicemen, selected by ballot, settled there,
1 CONT with the provision that repayment of advances made to these men should be used to benefit others less
1 CONT fortunate. Ken also personally financially assisted a significant number of men, both Maori and Pakeha, in the
1 CONT years following WW1. A fluent speaker of the Maori language, Ken was keenly interested in, and highly esteemed
1 CONT by, the Maori of Ngatiporou.
1 CONT Ken was chairman of the Waiapu County Council and a member of the Tokomaru Harbour Board and the Waiapu
1 CONT Hospital Board, He won five elections, three of them unopposed, as Bay of Plenty Member of Parliament
1 CONT (1920-35) and was Minister of Public Works (1926-28). He was awarded the King's Jubilee Medal in 1935. Ken
1 CONT was a Poverty Bay rugby representative in 1903.
1 CONT Lillian took little part in community affairs, but had a deep faith in God and was always a regular church
1 CONT attender. She was also a gracious hostess and welcomed a continuous stream of visitors at "Matahiia". She was
1 CONT a prolific letter writer and kept in regular contact with her constantly expanding extended family until she
1 CONT was well into her eighties.
1 CONT Matahiia Station
1 CONT In 1883 Archdeacon Samuel Williams through the agency of Col Porter bought extensive land interests in the
1 CONT Waiapu district. Included was the "Matahiia" Block. Francis James Kemp came from the Bay of Islands to manage
1 CONT it, and in 1885 he married Samuel's niece, Marianne Elizabeth Georgina Hutton. From 1886 to 1898, "Matahiia",
1 CONT along with other Williams properties, was administered by Mr A H Wallis who lived at Waipiro Bay. In 1892
1 CONT Samuel Williams was in debt on the property and so he brought his two nephews, Thomas
1 CONT Sydney Williams and Kenneth Stuart Williams, from the Bay of Islands. He offered them the chance to start off
1 CONT on some land on their own account if they could clear the debt.
1 CONT In the 1880s Samuel built a kauri woolshed on "Matahiia". It had twenty stands and held 1300 ewes and 1500
1 CONT lambs in the night pens. It had a large wool floor capable of holding enough bales for three to six horse
1 CONT wagons. At this time the wool was carted to "Tupuroa" where it was shipped by surfboat out to coastal
1 CONT steamers. Sheep from much of the surrounding country were brought to "Matahiia" to be shorn - up to 60,000
1 CONT sheep in a peak year. In 1897 ten machine stands were installed.
1 CONT "Mokoiwi" which adjoined the back of "Matahiia" went to Gerard Temple Williams, and when he died on a hospital
1 CONT ship at Gallipoli, his sister, Sarah Catherine (Kitty) Taplin, sister of KS Williams, took over "Mokoiwi". In
1 CONT 1917 "Matahiia" was offered to the Government for soldier settlement but the erosion problem meant that it was
1 CONT considered unsuitable. In 1918 Kenneth Stuart Williams gave his wagoner, Jimmy Arnold, a section of land, and
1 CONT he also gave his plowman, "Nob' Walter Cousins, some land comprising 250 acres of flat and 150 acres of hill.
1 CONT Eventually the Taplins took over Cousins' farm, which the Government bought and subsequently leased and called
1 CONT it "Mangarewarewa". After the Taplins died, this property was bought by John William Stuart Williams, elder
1 CONT son of John Dow Williams, who was Charles Kenneth Williams' younger brother. In 1924 the management of
1 CONT "Matahiia" was taken over by Charles Kenneth Williams, the eldest son of KS Williams.
1 CONT In 1938 the old homestead was burnt down by a fencer on the property. CK Williams built a new homestead on a
1 CONT different site, and a smaller house was built in the old gardens for Kenneth's widow, Lillian Mary Williams.
1 CONT Until 1932 the only access to "Matahiia" was across the Mata River, subject to heavy flooding. In 1957 the
1 CONT last of the waterways were bridged giving almost all weather access after 74 years of ownership. In 1950
1 CONT Kenneth Sydney Williams, eldest son of CK Williams took over stock management on "Matahiia".
1 CONT In 1960 the two brothers, Charles and John, agreed to divide "Matahiia" and John called his block "Taitai"
1 CONT station, which was subsequently taken over by his elder son, Stuart, in 1971. Kenneth Sydney then took over
1 CONT full management of "Matahiia”. In 1963 CK and Phyllis Williams moved to Gisborne and Ken and his wife, Jose,
1 CONT and their five children moved into the Matahiia homestead. "Matahiia" is now managed by Ken and Jose's two
1 CONT sons, Jeremy Kenneth Williams and Timothy Charles Bentham Williams.

1 CONT Joseph Hadfield (silk merchant) and Amelia Caroline White, b. at Bonchurch, Isle of Wight
1 CONT and d, at Marton.
1 CONT Octavius suffered ill health for most of his life. It curtailed his education and,
1 CONT although he was accepted for service by the Church Missionary Society, he could not be
1 CONT ordained in London because he did not have a degree. He went to Australia in 1838 and
1 CONT while in Sydney was made deacon. In 1839 he came to New Zealand with Bishop Broughton and became the first priest
1 CONT to be ordained in New Zealand. He worked for a while at Waimate North, learning the Maori language, then
1 CONT volunteered to go with Tamihana (son of Te Rauparaha) and his cousin, Te WhiWhi, who had come north seeking a
1 CONT missionary for the Kapiti Coast. Working from Otaki among the Ngati Toa and the Ngati Raukawa and also from
1 CONT Waikanae among the Te Atiawa, Octavius established churches and schools. One of his most notable achievements was
1 CONT to plead for peace when, as a result of the Wairau incident in 1843, Te Rauparaha was determined to destroy the
1 CONT pakeha settlement at Wellington.
1 CONT In 1844 Octavius suffered a complete breakdown in health and for four years he was close to death. But throughout
1 CONT his illness he was an influential figure in Wellington, being frequently consulted by Governor George Grey,
1 CONT especially on matters of land tenure. In 1849 his health had improved and he returned to Otaki and was appointed
1 CONT Archdeacon of Kapiti.
1 CONT Octavius was increasingly at odds with Government policy over Maori affairs, and in particular over the war which
1 CONT erupted at Waitara in 1860. He was vilified in the press, being described as a 'traitor and a bigoted, meddlesome
1 CONT missionary'. However, in the end, even Prime Minister Stafford agreed that Octavius had been proved right.
1 CONT When the Diocese of Wellington was formed in 1858 Octavius was offered the bishopric, but declined. When Bishop
1 CONT Abraham resigned in 1870, Octavius was again offered the position, and this time he accepted. In 1890 he was
1 CONT elected third Anglican Primate of New Zealand, a position he held until his retirement to Marton in 1893.

1 CONT Jane, d/o James and Anna Maria Nelson, b. at Nottingham and d. and bd. at Napier.
1 CONT William was educated at a small private school then at Southwell Grammar School. He
1 CONT completed an apprenticeship with Mr Southwell, a surgeon, then attended Magdalen Hall,
1 CONT Oxford for two years. In 1824 he received a BA in Classics and was ordained a deacon then
1 CONT a priest by the Bishop of London. Following their marriage, William and Jane sailed for
1 CONT New Zealand on 14 August 1825 aboard the "Sir George Osborne" and, after staying a short time in Sydney, arrived at
1 CONT Paihia on 26 March 1826.
1 CONT With his scholarship and natural gift for languages, William quickly learnt Maori and took a leading part in
1 CONT translating the Bible and Prayer Book. He also taught at the mission school, acted as the doctor and assisted with
1 CONT the general maintenance of the buildings and facilities. In 1830 he built himself a two-storeyed stone house (which
1 CONT was destroyed by fire in 1856). In 1834 William made his first visit to Waiapu, travelling by sea, and conducting
1 CONT services there for large crowds of natives. This was followed by several more journeys. He sailed with William
1 CONT Fairburn and Rev J Wilson to assist them to set up the Puriri station, then led an expedition into the Waikato to
1 CONT prepare a site for a station at Mangapouri. He continued on to the Thames Valley and through to Tauranga.
1 CONT In 1835 William and Jane moved to Waimate where William supervised the missionary school, completed work on his
1 CONT Maori dictionary and continued with the translation of the New Testament. He made another visit to Poverty Bay in
1 CONT 1838, travelling overland from the East Cape to Turanga. Then, at the end of 1839, he and Jane and family moved to
1 CONT Turanga to establish a permanent mission there. He was appointed Archdeacon of East Cape in 1842 and in 1859 he was
1 CONT consecrated Bishop of Waiapu.
1 CONT At the end of 1850 William left for England with Jane and two of their children. He presented a report to the
1 CONT parent Committee of the Church Missionary Society, and made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade them to reinstate
1 CONT his brother, Henry. They arrived back in Paihia in October 1852 and returned to Turanga eight months later.
1 CONT In 1857 the mission was moved to Waerenga-a-hika where there was land available for a mission farm and the
1 CONT establishment of training schools. During the early 1860's the Hauhau movement gained momentum, and their leaders
1 CONT declared their intention to kill William, whose influence was frustrating their aims. Following the murder of
1 CONT Volkner at Opotiki in March 1865, William and his family left in April for Napier and Auckland. In 1867 William and
1 CONT his family moved to Hawke's Bay and Napier became the new headquarters of his diocese. During this period he worked
1 CONT closely with his son-in-law and nephew, Samuel Williams, in the establishment of Te Aute College and Hukarere Maori
1 CONT Girls' School.
1 CONT Jane met William when she was engaged as a pupil teacher at the school in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, run by
1 CONT Williams's mother, Mary. Although never physically strong, she provided a constant support and assistance to
1 CONT William in all aspects of his work. She taught Maori girls and women the arts of household management and developed
1 CONT a close bond of friendship with many of their parishioners. During William's many long absences Jane supervised the
1 CONT day-to-day running of the mission. Her obituary stated: 'The treasure William Williams brought to these shores was
1 CONT that bright, intelligent, courageous and cheerful soul'.

1 CONT Maria b. at Waimate and d. at Hukarere, Napier.
1 CONT Maria was Lady Superintendent of Hukarere Girls' School which first opened at Hukarere Road,
1 CONT Napier in 1875. She kept the accounts and conducted the correspondence of the school from its
1 CONT inception and generally supervised the matron and teachers until these duties were taken over by
1 CONT the officers of the Te Aute Trust Board in 1911.
1 CONT Maria with her sisters, Lydia and Marianne were known within the family as the Hukarere Aunts.
1 CONT The following is a memoir on these three ladies, written in 1973 by their grandniece, Bettie Williams:
1 CONT 'I was often taken to visit the Hukarere Aunts, the unmarried sisters of my grandfather, JN Williams. Even
1 CONT then they seemed like something out of another age and dressed much as their mother would have done - always in
1 CONT black and in a simplified version of the style of the 1890's. This was in the second decade of the 20th
1 CONT Century. The black was unrelieved except for a little white ruff at the neck and a frilled white lace cap. Aunt
1 CONT Marianne, the youngest, wore no cap and a long-sleeved blouse in a fine granny print with her plain black
1 CONT skirt. Aunt Maria would have been in her seventies and, though she lived to be ninety, seemed to us very old.
1 CONT Tiny, fragile and crippled with arthritis, she walked with a stick and spent most of her time on a horse-hair
1 CONT sofa or the cane and mahogany couch now in Waipare Gran's bedroom, not very comfortable for old bones. Aunt
1 CONT Kate, two years younger, was the lively one. Tall, thin and vivacious, I believe she had been very beautiful in
1 CONT her youth. She spent her life in good works and taught for some years at the Hukarere Maori Girls' College. We
1 CONT loved her and she took great pains to make our visits fun. Always a party tea round the dining room table -
1 CONT bread and butter with hundreds and thousands and a little cut glass dish of boiled sweets for each child. A
1 CONT cupboard full of dolls and other toys, the home-made bricks we have at Hapua among them. They were given to Jon
1 CONT by Aunt Marianne. The house was dark and very Victorian - horsehair and bamboo, probably much as in their
1 CONT parents' day. Aunt Kate died in 1931 after she was injured in the Cathedral wrecked by the earthquake in
1 CONT February of that year, a few weeks before Jon's birth and two years after the death of Maria. Marianne died the
1 CONT following year. Aunt Kate once stayed with us at Atua, I think after my father died. I remember her in a
1 CONT voluminous apron, lace cap and all, making cherry jam,

1 CONT Leonard b. at Paihia, m. in England and d. at Taumata, Napier. He was Bishop of the Waiapu
1 CONT Diocese. Sarah, d/o John Bradshaw Wanklyn of Halecat, Westmorland.
1 CONT As a teenager Leonard used to accompany his father on some of his many journeys around the
1 CONT country, travelling through the bush with the help of Maori guides. In 1847 he was sent to
1 CONT England and completed a BA degree with honours at Oxford University. He then offered his
1 CONT services to the Church Missionary Society and was admitted to Deacons Orders in May 1853.
1 CONT He met Sarah whilst visiting his aunt, Mrs Heathcote, and they sailed for New Zealand in June 1853, shortly after
1 CONT their marriage.
1 CONT At the time of Sarah's eighth confinement in 1866, there was much unrest among the Maoris caused by Te Kooti and
1 CONT his Hau Hau warriors, who at one stage threatened to kill Bishop William Williams. In January of that year William
1 CONT and Sarah moved into a small cottage at the foot of Kaiti Hill and close to the mouth of the Turanganui River near
1 CONT where the Cook Monument now stands. This was considered to be reasonably safe.
1 CONT There was considerable speculation amongst the local Maoris, who were both loyal and friendly, as to whether the
1 CONT new child would be a boy or a girl, or even more than one. Maori kuia summed up the situation by saying, "Waikahua
1 CONT - Waikatohu". (Who knows? - Who can tell?). Thus when Frank and Sydney were born in December of that year they were
1 CONT dubbed by the Maori Waikahua and Waikatohu. The cottage where William and Sarah lived near Gisborne became known as
1 CONT Waikahua Cottage.
1 CONT Leonard took little part in public life, spending his time in the service of the CMS, mainly among the Maori
1 CONT people. He was consecrated 3rd Bishop of Waiapu in 1895 and held the position until 1909.
1 CONT Throughout his life Leonard continued to work on the Maori Dictionary producing a 3rd edition which was published
1 CONT in London in 1871 and a 4th edition published in Auckland in 1892. This was many times larger and more
1 CONT comprehensive than the 1st edition which had been compiled by his father, William at Paihia in 1844. (A 2nd edition
1 CONT had been published in London in 1852). In later years Leonard and his son, Herbert worked on a revision, finally
1 CONT published by Herbert as the 5th edition in Wellington in 1917.
1 CONT Leonard was a keen botanist and acquired considerable knowledge in this field. At Hick's Bay near the East Cape he
1 CONT discovered a native broom which was named Carmichaelia Williamsii after him.

1 CONT Grammar School, Auckland, and in 1873 he entered the office of Messrs Kinross &
1 CONT Company in Napier. In 1880 he started in business on his own account and a few years
1 CONT later he entered into partnership with Nathaniel Kettle. In 1891 the business became
1 CONT known as Williams & Kettle Ltd and Frederick became Chairman of Directors, a position he held until his
1 CONT retirement in 1918 (although he remained a director of the company until his death).
1 CONT In association with George Edward Gordon Richardson, Frederick was involved in the founding of the shipping
1 CONT company later known as Richardson & Company Ltd, and was Chairman from 1900 to 1940. For over 50 years he was
1 CONT a committee member of the Hawkes Bay Permanent Building and Investment Society, and Chairman for 28 years. He

1 CONT For many years Frederick was trustee of the Foster, Nairn and Makarini Trusts. He took a particular interest

1 CONT Fray b. at Gisborne and m. in London. Penny, d/o Edward Montague Moneypenny and Hannah Fairweather, b.
1 CONT in South Africa. Address: PO Box 203, Waikanae 6454.
1 CONT Fray was educated by correspondence and at Wanganui Collegiate School from 1935 to 1938. In his last
1 CONT year he was a prefect in Harvey House. In 1939 he took a position as a junior master at Waihi School
1 CONT in South Canterbury as an intermission before moving on to University. With indications that war was
1 CONT coming, this may not have been the most appropriate advice, but perhaps that year contributed to a
1 CONT better result in the end. Most of 1940 was spent at Victoria University College in Wellington and
1 CONT towards the end of that year he enlisted in the RNZAF. He was not called up until June of 1941 and in
1 CONT August he sailed with a large contingent for Canada and joined the Empire Air Training Scheme.
1 CONT His group reached England in February of 1942 and in September he and his crew were posted to No 75(NZ)
1 CONT Squadron a unit of No 3 Group RAF Bomber Command, In May of the following year they were one of the
1 CONT first three crews to complete a tour of operations in that interval of eight months. In that time the
1 CONT squadron had lost a total of twenty eight other crews of which a small number of individuals survived
1 CONT as prisoners and an even smaller number successfully evaded and returned to England. In February 1944
1 CONT Fray returned to No 75 Squadron in an executive capacity and flew on another eighteen operations with
1 CONT ten different crews. By this time the survival rate was much improved but after the War 75 was
1 CONT estimated to have suffered heavier losses than any other squadron in the whole of Bomber Command,
1 CONT except for one. At the end of the war Fray held the rank of Squadron Leader, had been awarded the DFC
1 CONT and been Mentioned in Dispatches.
1 CONT After the War Fray looked for employment in England because his lack of qualifications and the
1 CONT uncertain prospects at home made return to New Zealand rather speculative. He flew with what is now
1 CONT British Airways on flying boats between UK and Singapore for a year, but a high tone deafness
1 CONT attributed to war-time flying threatened the renewal of his licence and he was forced to resign. He
1 CONT secured a position with Vickers Armstrong but shortly afterward was offered a Short Service commission
1 CONT with the RNZAF. Since this provided him with secure employment prospects in New Zealand and an
1 CONT opportunity to get his wife and daughter out of England, it was accepted. Two years into that
1 CONT engagement he was offered a permanent commission but once again his hearing disability prevented him
1 CONT from pursuing this. The RNZAF agreed to release him at his discretion and he cast about for other
1 CONT opportunities.
1 CONT At about this time the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now known as BP, had formed a joint venture company
1 CONT with the New Zealand Government and was recruiting staff. Fray applied to them and was accepted. He
1 CONT joined in 1949 and served with the Company in Gisborne, Wellington, Christchurch and London. By 1970
1 CONT he was Assistant General Manager and after five years in that position he assessed that further
1 CONT advancement was problematical and invoked a clause in his contract which allowed him to take early
1 CONT retirement at the age of 55.
1 CONT In early 1976 Fray and Penny built an additional house on "Mangarara" Station and moved up there to
1 CONT live. In 1977 Fray was elected to the Cook County Council, and in 1980 was elected Chairman. It would
1 CONT be true to say that coming from a commercial background he found much that he believed could be changed
1 CONT for the better. Naturally these views were not universally accepted and he was strongly challenged in
1 CONT 1983. Rather than face the prospect of presiding over what was likely to be a divided council, he
1 CONT withdrew his nomination and two years later resigned in his third term prior to moving to Waikanae
1 CONT where he and Penny now live.
1 CONT Penny was educated at Girls' High School in Pretoria and when her parents and sister Frankie moved to
1 CONT England in 1938 she remained in South Africa to study art and drama. She joined her family in England
1 CONT in 1941. After a short spell as VAD, she joined the WAAF, training near Lossiemouth in the north of
1 CONT Scotland. In 1943 she was posted as a Sergeant to the RAF station at Meepal in East Anglia and it was
1 CONT there that she met and married Fray. After moving to Gisborne, Penny found limited opportunities to
1 CONT pursue her interest in art so she turned her attention to drama, taking leading roles in various
1 CONT productions by Gisborne Repertory and in many play readings. In 1952 the family moved to Wellington

1 CONT William was educated at Warwick College, leaving at the age of 15 to work in a tannery, a cement

1 CONT on 26 Oct 1862 on the "Devonshire", arriving at Auckland on 4 February 1863. They had introductions
1 CONT to Henry and William Williams and this may have influenced their decision to settle in Hawkes Bay.
1 CONT They were met in Napier by JN Williams and taken by him to "Kereru" Station. In 1864 they purchased "Poporangi",
1 CONT an adjoining property and the following year William returned to England to marry Sarah Newcombe Bicknell. In the
1 CONT meantime Fred had purchased "Arlington", a 14,000-acre property near Waipukurau from Captain Alfred Newman and
1 CONT William and Sarah settled there. In 1869 the brothers purchased the Maungateretere East Block of 2,047 acres near
1 CONT Hastings and built their house, known as "The Lawn". The property included a flax swamp and William set up a flax
1 CONT mill, intent on exporting flax fibre. However, the market slumped, as did the wool market, and this, along with
1 CONT plague of grasshoppers, forced them to surrender the Arlington and Kereru properties to the mortgagee. Leaving
1 CONT Fred to run the Maungateretere Block, William took his family back to England and worked again in the gelatine
1 CONT business at Warwick.
1 CONT In 1880 William returned to New Zealand and he and Fred established the company of Nelson Brothers and Williams
1 CONT Ltd, building a plant at Tomoana to can, boil down and treat wool and pelts. When, two years later, the "Dunedin"
1 CONT shipped the first cargo of frozen meat to London, Nelson Brothers Ltd was formed in London to take over the assets
1 CONT of the canning works and quickly set up a freezing works. The first frozen meat left Napier at the end of 1883. .
1 CONT As the new industry developed, the Nelsons began purchasing suitable properties for fattening and soon owned 19
1 CONT farms totalling 60,000 acres, as well as holding the lease on "Loch Inver", a 30,000-acre run.
1 CONT In 1889-90 they opened works in Gisborne, Waipukurau, Woodville and at Ocean Beach in Southland. The also bought
1 CONT their own refrigerated vessel, the "Prince of Wales".
1 CONT During their married life, William and Sarah had a family of five sons and four daughters before Sarah's death at
1 CONT "The Lawn" in 1883. A year later William married Emma Caroline and they made their home at "Waikoko", a property
1 CONT near Tomoana that William bought from Robert Wellwood in 1884.
1 CONT In 1882 William was instrumental in establishing Heretaunga School in Hastings. The buildings were moved to
1 CONT Havelock North in 1912 and later became Hereworth School. He also set up Woodford House as a boarding school for
1 CONT girls. He was involved in the reclamation of Napier South and Nelson Park in Napier was named after him in
1 CONT recognition of his enterprise.
1 CONT William was a long-time member of the Hawkes Bay Club and Patron of the Hawkes Bay Cricket Association and the

1 CONT Following Emma's death in 1921, William married Katharine Maud Orford on 16 September 1922. "Waikoko" was
